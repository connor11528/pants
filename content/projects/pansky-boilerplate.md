For over 90 years Goodwill Dallas has been committed to providing job training and employment to  those with disabilities and disadvantaging conditions.

As part of the creative department of [Miller Ad Agency](http://milleradagency.com), we collaborated and worked to bring Goodwill Dallas the new life it came looking for.

Goodwill Dallas prides itself on the success of its clients, the disadvantaged individuals that find new life from Goodwill’s humanitarian efforts. To emphasize this, we hired a top-tier local professional photographer to capture Goodwill Dallas in its everyday life. These photos, after minor post-processing, produced extremely powerful images to feature throughout this new identity package; brochures, deliverables, on the website, etc. These pictures really sold the emotional impact that Goodwill Dallas strives for when helping those in need.

Next, we tackled their logo. Due to national corporate regulations, there was only so much we could do. Can’t do this and can’t do that; our creativity here was severely limited. However, sometimes the more barriers around a project - the more ingenuity must be conjured. The end product for the logo was clean, minimal, and excellent.

We created a style guide, business cards, folding brochures, a complete website overhaul, and much more. It was a pleasure to work with Goodwill Industries of Dallas and we continue to cooperate in joint endeavors to this day.

#### My roles
My part revolved around the website. Everything from structure to wireframing to conceptual mockups to production assets to HTML and vanilla CSS (not discovering Sass until well after this project’s completion).

If you're interested in browsing around the pre-redesign version of the website, you can head on over to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20140110155931/http://goodwilldallas.org/).
