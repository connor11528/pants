      <description>For over 90 years Goodwill Dallas has been committed to providing job training and employment to those with disabilities and disadvantaging conditions.
As part of the creative department of Miller Ad Agency, we collaborated and worked to bring Goodwill Dallas the new life it came looking for.
Goodwill Dallas prides itself on the success of its clients, the disadvantaged individuals that find new life from Goodwill’s humanitarian efforts. To emphasize this, we hired a top-tier local professional photographer to capture Goodwill Dallas in its everyday life.</description>
