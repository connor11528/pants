      <Title><![CDATA[Get with the Global, Let’s get Mobile]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[If you haven’t yet made your website mobile friendly, it’s time to come out from under your rock and get on board with the rest of the world. ]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;MobileSite&quot; class=&quot;alignright wp-image-1183&quot; src=&quot;http://www.stampedeadagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MobileSite.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 407px; height: 450px;&quot; /&gt; Get with the Global, Let&amp;rsquo;s get Mobile. Could we see another Google algorithm change coming soon? If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet made your website mobile friendly, it&amp;rsquo;s time to come out from under your rock and get on board with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has recently been sending out a huge amount of notifications to webmasters that have been missing the boat with optimizing their websites for mobile users. Simply telling them, your site is not &amp;ldquo;mobile Friendly&amp;rdquo; and will be displayed and ranked accordingly for smartphone users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this seems like a verbal slap on the wrist, I feel Google is foreshadowing yet another Google algorithm change for the near future. One could assume, by eliminating non-mobile sites from mobile search entirely (hopefully), but the company has not yet made any such announcement. Clearly, with the number of smartphone users continually growing it&amp;rsquo;s more important now than ever to have your site mobile friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only so you can rank well with Google, but so that the users of your site don&amp;rsquo;t have to go through the frustration of dealing with unreadable content and tiny links. Nobody wants to take their second hand off the wheel to zoom in on your content. If it&amp;rsquo;s me, and I pull up that site, you can most likely assume I&amp;rsquo;ll be contributing to your bounce rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help with this frustration, Google introduced the broken mobile site penalty in 2013, and last year they released a statement saying they&amp;rsquo;re experimenting with adding a mobile friendly label to its mobile search results. So with this sending of mass notifications to sites and re-sending to sites that are knowingly not mobile friendly, I smell a bigger change on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this is leading up to new mobile exclusive solution for mobile web browsing. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the messages that are being sent to webmasters. Note the &amp;ldquo;Fix this now&amp;rdquo; label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a final warning to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Baby It’s Cold Outside]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Since we rarely get ice and snow in the Dallas area, when we do, it becomes a top news story on every local channel. You can turn on your TV and be guaranteed to have full coverage of what the roads are like, what schools and businesses are closing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so thrilled this year to see the &amp;ldquo;Texas Storm Chasers&amp;rdquo; on the actual roads with cameras and fairly hilarious commentaries.&amp;nbsp; It gave me more confidence as to when to attempt to head into the office; however, I never heard the station I watched mention &amp;ldquo;This update is sponsored by ___&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that was a missed opportunity.&amp;nbsp; What better way for a Jeep dealership to brag again that they are the award winning &amp;ldquo;2014 Official Winter Vehicle&amp;rdquo; than to sponsor a storm chaser morning update from 6am to 9:30am?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller Ad Agency is always on the look-out for those opportunities!&amp;nbsp; Give us a call and see what Miller can do for you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Finding Inspiration]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[So what can a struggling team do to kick start their brains? We take to the Internet or our agency’s bookshelf to scan other published work trying to find that light switch.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;inspiration_header&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/inspiration_header.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graphic designer, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find inspiration when crafting a new project. Similar to glaring at an empty word processing page when writing a blog, starting a new development takes a fair amount of mental prowess. You and your creative colleagues must band together, partners in crime, to concept the latest endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can a struggling team do to kick start their brains? We take to the Internet or our agency&amp;rsquo;s bookshelf to scan other published work trying to find that light switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop open Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (don&amp;rsquo;t use Internet Explorer, what is wrong with you?) and go perusing the plethora of blogs across the web; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abduzeedo.com&quot;/ target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Abuzeebo&quot;&gt;Abuzeebo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthedesigner.com&quot;/ target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;You The Designer&quot;&gt;You The Designer&lt;/a&gt; are merely two examples. You can even just perform a quick search and come across any number of lists featuring interesting little blogs. You&amp;rsquo;ll find lists such as, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.domainehome.com/best-international-interior-design-blogs-2014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;7 International Design Blogs&quot;&gt;7 International Design Blogs You Should Be Following&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/12/the-15-best-design-blogs-of-2013.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Best Design Blogs&quot;&gt;The 15 Best Design Blogs of 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Outside of the blogging realm, a struggling designer or team can browse through some of their personal favorite agency&amp;rsquo;s latest portfolio work. Go check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.invisiblecreature.com/#/work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Invisible Creature&quot;&gt;Invisible Creature&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arsthanea.com/work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Ars Thanea&quot;&gt;Ars Thanea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;invisible-lion&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/invisible-lion.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes physicality is in order by putting your fingertips to pages. Flipping through printed materials can be very therapeutic and inspiring. From magazines like &lt;a href=&quot;http://layersmagazine.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Layers&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Layers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printmag.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Print&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Print&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmykmag.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;CMYK&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CMYK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commarts.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Communication Arts&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication Arts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativebloq.com/computer-arts-magazine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Computer Arts&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer Arts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to books such as, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Typography-Friedrich-Friedl/dp/1579120237&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Typography by Friedrich Friedl&quot;&gt;Typography: An Encyclopedic Survey of Type Design and Techniques Throughout History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Friedrich Friedl, Nicolaus Ott, and Bernard Stein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes simply momentarily distancing yourself from a design-oriented consciousness can improve your awareness of how design is all around us; inspiration is everywhere. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not found in blogs and books, but outside in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources abundant. You&amp;rsquo;ll find exactly what clicks for your next project. You just need to look for it &amp;ndash; or don&amp;rsquo;t look for it. As a designer, it will always come to you; you&amp;rsquo;ve trained your brain to do as such.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[Have you ever sat down and really paid attention the messages both subtle and not so subtle on TV?  Have you ever flipped thru a magazine and really looked at the models?]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;catlion&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/catlion.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;&quot; /&gt;Have you ever sat down and really paid attention the messages both subtle and not so subtle on TV?&amp;nbsp; Have you ever flipped thru a magazine and really looked at the models?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to really start paying attention for a month.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because I now have teenage nieces or if because I myself am feeling rather insecure about my weight but I have started to notice a bit of a trend and I have to say I am happy about it and hope it continues if not grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am noticing that some of the actors in the spots, are not all size zero!&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s about time!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dove seemed to be on the front lines of the &amp;ldquo;Love yourself&amp;rdquo; message.&amp;nbsp; Dove has been doing a lot to help young girls, let me rephrase girls of any age&amp;rsquo;s self-image.&amp;nbsp; Last year they posted&amp;nbsp; the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=litXW91UauE&quot;&gt;Real Beauty&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; video&amp;rsquo;s on YouTube and those have been see by over 5 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, they are helping us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou7CyPtkpng&quot;&gt;curly haired gals&lt;/a&gt; embrace our curls and no longer feel inferior to our straight hair sisters. Now, TJ Maxx is using curvy models in their spring campaign, and not just to advertise their &amp;ldquo;plus sized&amp;rdquo; clothing.&amp;nbsp; As a &amp;ldquo;curvy&amp;rdquo; gal myself I am thankful that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to see size &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; models as the ultimate goal.&amp;nbsp; I just read a blog that a male friend posted on Facebook.&amp;nbsp; It was about a woman who has finally embraced her body type, whatever it ends up being.&amp;nbsp; Her blogs talks about her relationship with her body from adolescence to motherhood.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting blog called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nestingstory.ca/what-having-four-kids-including-twins-has-done-to-my-body-and-my-confidence/&quot;&gt;nestingstory.ca&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I totally agree that as a society we are the fattest we have ever been and we should make a better effort to get more fit. However, I worry that as we see models that are too thin or actresses that are photo shopped to unrealistic proportions that are we teaching the younger generation unrealistic ideals.&amp;nbsp; What I like about this seeming trend, is that the advertising community is letting young girls know that it&amp;rsquo;s ok to be different and the most important thing is to love yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thankful to TJ Maxx, Dove, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/0d0bdDaj614&quot;&gt;American Express&lt;/a&gt; and to other companies that they get that any size can be and is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;advert-on-facebook&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/advert-on-facebook.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a Ever find yourself aimlessly scrolling through your Facebook newsfeed and all of a sudden you see that product you were JUST looking at on another website pop up with an alluring &amp;ldquo;sale going on now!&amp;rdquo; or an ad of a box full of dog toys and treats that you can subscribe to have delivered to your home monthly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a creepy yet exciting way, Facebook has discovered how to dig deep into my cyber footprint and I am dumped into a variety of categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog owner, twenty-something, female, college educated, car enthusiast are just a few of the audiences I belong to. And I am constantly reminded of this. Every day my newsfeed fills with advertisements of yoga studios, car dealerships, oil change coupons, bark boxes, online boutiques, car dealerships, concert tickets, doggy daycare, fitness programs, Nordstrom&amp;rsquo;s, and did I mention car dealerships??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I spend a big portion of my time online looking at car dealerships, this category serves me 3x more ads than the others. That being said, depending on what you look at the most online, Facebook can track your interests and hobbies and in turn will serve you ads based on those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few options for the ads being served. When a user clicks on the ad, it can either lead them to the actual company website OR to the company&amp;rsquo;s Facebook page. We recommend linking ads directly to the company website because it is a great way to drive traffic and engaged consumers to your online inventory. Happy Facebook advertising ☺!&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Is Advertising a Mind Game?]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[You may only hear it once or twice in your 30 minute commute, but hearing that tune Monday thru Friday once or twice a day, will give you a case of déjà vu, so every time you hear it, makes you think it’s the millionth time.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;On your way to work, how many times would you say you hear the Walgreens commercial, you know the one with the little song that goes like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BhYhyAaxrs&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BhYhyAaxrs&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may only hear it once or twice in your 30 minute commute, but hearing that tune Monday thru Friday once or twice a day, will give you a case of d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu, so every time you hear it, makes you think it&amp;rsquo;s the millionth time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet you will start hearing the Walgreens commercial much more often; just proof that advertising works! Saying advertising is a mind game is like saying life is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have been checking out the new Accords, all of the sudden you see them EVERYWHERE! Or if my friend and I are talking about having more kids, guess what, we see pregnant women everywhere. If you are in the market for something, you will pay attention to those ads, and you will remember them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising is definitely not a mind game nor a waste of time. Having the right agency can help you target the perfect audience that will mind your ads. So please, call the Advertising Geniuses at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.milleradagency.com/&quot;&gt;Miller Ad Agency&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Whipping Our Millennial Marketing into Shape]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Here are 3 relatively simple changes that will positively impact the attraction of the Millennial audience.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;99% of consumers expect their car shopping experience to be a &amp;lsquo;hassle&amp;rsquo; (according to the recently completed Consumer Experience survey by Driving Sales).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear systemic incitement, pointing to the fact that nearly every step in the purchase funnel has room for improvement including how we market to consumers. &amp;nbsp;In the spirit of eating this elephant one bite at a time, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on how we can shape our marketing to face the now largest segment of our population, the Millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born from 1981-1997, they will overtake the Baby Boomers this year in total population and range in age from 18-34. Attracting and retaining this population of consumers will pave the way for a successful future for those willing to address them on their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 3 relatively simple changes that will positively impact the attraction of the Millennial audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;millennialmarketing&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/millennialmarketing.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t declare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with our broadcast messaging, how we communicate via radio and television. The vast majority of broadcast marketing from dealers is &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; in nature, stating facts or superlatives. &amp;ldquo;We have the lowest prices. We have the best selection&amp;rdquo;. The Millennials love to &lt;em&gt;participate&lt;/em&gt; in a conversation, to be &lt;em&gt;asked versus told. &lt;/em&gt;Scripts that ask more questions (even those that are overtly rhetorical) will engage this audience. &amp;ldquo;Do you love getting a good deal? Would a bigger selection make it easier for you to buy your next car?&amp;rdquo; These &amp;ldquo;asks&amp;rdquo; also allow for the messaging to extend easily into social media. Imagine the spot (radio or TV) that concludes with an invitation to continue the conversation online? &amp;ldquo;Tell us how you&amp;rsquo;d like to buy your next car @SouthWestFord #carshoppingfun&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Their Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you respond to on online lead submission, from a Millennial or to anyone for that matter, you are marketing. Most dealers fail to recognize this uncomfortable fact, and is probably a topic worthy of another article. Simply put, besides the speed that is universally required these days, a &lt;em&gt;thoughtful and intelligent &lt;/em&gt;response will dramatically increase your chances for continued engagement. Does your response encourage further conversation (see above: don&amp;rsquo;t declare)? Does it include a link to video? Does is include your picture? Does it make an intelligent offer to purchase with many choices? One of the most compelling tools on the market today is the ability to do a soft pull of a consumers credit with just name/address (no SSN required) such that your responses to leads could include VERY specific, &lt;em&gt;personalized&lt;/em&gt; quotes on rates &amp;amp; payments. &amp;nbsp;#Gamechanger. &amp;nbsp;Millennials are accustomed to a world that conforms to their needs, where their Pandora channel plays them an increasingly more intelligent set of songs based on their likes and dislikes. Our world is more focused on personalizing experiences every day.&amp;nbsp;Does your marketing keep pace with this new paradigm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirror Them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales psychology 101, as people buy from people that are most like them, Millennials should be an ingredient in your TV spots, and should have a voice in your radio spots. While my generation has a sufficient case of Stockholm syndrome to tolerate what I call &amp;ldquo;Old dealer on lot spots&amp;rdquo;, the Millennials will tune that out completely. Start seeing your marketing efforts as a &lt;em&gt;mirror &lt;/em&gt;to the people you are trying to attract. Millennials are as communal as it gets and they want to see a village full of their kind, in your marketing AND on your showroom (read: staff). This extends into sound as well, where a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/pB3BToQyZmI&quot;&gt;jingle&lt;/a&gt; that anchors to their day in music will encourage engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Many of you are old enough to have Millennials as kids, some still living under your roof. Hold a focus group of one with that Millennial, and see how they&amp;rsquo;d like to consume automotive marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[How Far Will You Go for SEO?]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While a rare occurrence, changing your business name in an effort to increase search traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t unheard of. Changing your city&amp;rsquo;s name is a little bizarre and far-fetched. But how about changing your entire county&amp;rsquo;s name just to show up better in search results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;orlando-north-edit-2&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/orlando-north-edit-2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;&quot; /&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what Seminole County in Florida will be voting on today, to change their name to &amp;ldquo;Orlando North&amp;rdquo;. Officials believe that this change will help drive tourism to their hotels and attractions, drawing attention to their proximity to the tourist haven of Orlando. Will their efforts be worthwhile? While that is yet to be seen, my first instinct is to say yes. This re-branding effort could be successful SEO-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it might make them more likely to appear for Orlando based searches, if the name &amp;ldquo;Orlando North&amp;rdquo; is reflected accurately on their websites. However, I doubt the change will come without controversy. Vacationers looking for strictly Orlando based hotels and attractions could become frustrated when their search results potentially include destinations well outside the city center. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if other counties will take note if the proposed change is approved and successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will other counties soon follow suit? Will we begin seeing &amp;ldquo;Dallas North&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Dallas South&amp;rdquo;, or even &amp;ldquo;Dallas Far North East&amp;rdquo;? Only time will tell. In my opinion, it seems a little nuts to go this far for SEO. But, it also proves just how important SEO is in your marketing efforts. If you&amp;#39;ve been questioning whether or not your business needs SEO, this might just be the wake-up call you needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[The Importance of the Right Media Buy]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[It takes industry knowledge, negotiation skills and just plain hard work to make the right media buy for the client.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The other night, Meet the Press, a national political talk-show, was on in my kitchen. During one of the breaks, a local automobile shop aired a commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;media-buy&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/media-buy.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 30%; height: 30%;&quot; /&gt;So what was the problem? The shop in question is for buyers with low to no credit &amp;ndash; not exactly the demographic watching this particular show. The quality of the commercial itself was also very poor. So why was this commercial on during this show?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best case is they bought some other programming on this particular station that was more relevant for them, and this spot was simply bonus inventory. More likely? Their buyer simply bought large time slots without truly delving in to see the demographics for each show and making sure they line up with the clientele their dealership is trying to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes industry knowledge, negotiation skills and just plain hard work to make the right media buy for the client. Make sure your media buyer is up to task. And if you ever have a doubt, the Miller Ad Agency will do a FREE analysis for you to ensure every dollar you&amp;rsquo;re spending is working as hard as you are.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Proofreading your work and checking every revision seems like a no-brainer right? I thought so too, until I made a few (only two, but they did enough damage) rookie mistakes on recent pieces for my clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First things first&lt;/strong&gt;, proofreading is not the same as glancing, skimming, perusing or any other synonym Word can come up for me. Learned that little tidbit the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to know that with any agency there is a cycle of peak times during the month when everything is due that makes producing a piece you want to be perfect, with zero revisions, a cute fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last peak week at the agency, I ignored both of the knowledge bombs I just shared with you. My client workload was at an all-time high. I had Email marketing campaign starts, TV and radio production deadlines, direct mail drop dates, digital campaign launches, you name it- it was due. It&amp;rsquo;s like all my clients got together and decided to make all of their deadlines on the same date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May I was busy launching a five-store full court press campaign for one of my auto group clients while simultaneously trying to push a donor newsletter out for print for the non-profit account I lead, and things got messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after I thought I had AE life under control, smoothly launched a big campaign and sent a newsletter to print, I got a call from my client asking from where a tracking number came (yes that&amp;rsquo;s the correct what to say that sentence). After an exhaustive and panic-stricken search, I realized I duplicated a tracking number from the previous month&amp;rsquo;s direct mail piece, but it was too late. More than a thousand pieces had already been delivered into homes and a different dealership was getting all the leads. The clients were angry I wasted their money and an awesome mailing list, my superiors were frustrated with my rookie mistake on a big account, and I was mortified. In that week I sent so many revisions, requests for approvals, signed off on countless graphics and sent emails on top of emails to make sure everything was running smoothly, and in the midst of all the madness I forgot to take a step back, look with a fresh set of eyes and then proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a new AE, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be overwhelmed by the fast-paced nature of an ever-growing agency. Trial by fire is how you learn, even though it may be the hard way, to proof everything you can with a fine-toothed comb. Think of proofing a piece you&amp;rsquo;ve seen more than once as the last word you can&amp;rsquo;t find on a word search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stare at it long enough you can probably trick yourself into seeing what you have been in search of for 20 minutes. My suggestion, as a recently self-scorned proofer, is ASK FOR A BUDDY! Just a quick new set of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re rush-proofing or you just want something out of your hands it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see what you want to see, but if you take a quick lap around the office or ask your cube buddy to take a look at it for you, it can make all the difference. Keep those eyes fresh and those clients happy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[3 Ways to Use Contests on Social Media to Help You Sell More Cars]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[If you've got a good social media following, it might be time to move to the next level in social media marketing. Here are some ways to use contests to jumpstart your sales.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;What can social media contests do for your dealership? Contests drive customer engagement, boost your brand awareness, increase your social influence, and give you insight into what motivates, delights, and interests your customers&amp;mdash;all keys to moving more cars. If you&amp;#39;ve got a good social media following, it might be time to move to the next level in social media marketing. Here are some ways to use contests to jumpstart your sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Grow Your Email List with a Facebook &amp;quot;Vote&amp;quot; Contest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger your email list, the larger your pool of potential buyers to nurture along the purchasing path. Most businesses find there is very&lt;!--more--&gt; little crossover between their email subscribers and social fans, so getting your social fans into your CRM (customer relationship management) can really boost your marketing efforts. Facebook &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot; contests are easy to set up and easy for fans to participate in. You&amp;#39;ll need to incentivize them to enter their email, so choose a prize that appeals to fans, such as a $50 gas card or a free service from your service department. Then pick a theme; try ideas such as &amp;quot;What do you like to do in your Jeep?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your favorite Honda?&amp;quot; Post pictures of three or four options and let your fans vote. Be sure to set an end date, then select an entrant at random. Promote the winner on your Facebook page after the contest ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drive Engagement with an Instagram Photo Contest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram is the fastest growing social platform, with over 60 million photos shared each day generating 1.6 billion likes. Savvy car marketers are discovering its potential to attract and connect with customers, and a contest is a great way to rapidly grow your Instagram fan base. Photo challenges are the most popular type of contest on Instagram, so pick a theme and a prize and ask followers to post a photo on their Instagram account using your contest hashtag. A catchy hashtag is important so you can both promote your contest and track entries. Choose an attractive prize and be sure to share your rules. Possible contest ideas include asking followers to post a photo of their pet riding in their car with the hashtag #Along4theRide or #(your dealership name)Contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build Awareness with a Twitter Caption Contest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter audiences love caption contests, and these are also easy to set up. Tweet an intriguing, humorous, or entertaining photo, perhaps of one of your employees with one of your new vehicles, and ask your followers to submit a caption. Again, be sure to choose a catchy hashtag so you can track entries and choose a winner. A sample tweet looks something like this: &amp;quot;Tweet a fun caption for this picture and #win a free detail package! #CaptionContest #HarrisFord.&amp;quot; If your brand is active on Pinterest or YouTube, you can easily set up contests on these platforms, too. Just remember to post the rules and promote winning entries, no matter which platform you choose. You&amp;#39;ll be surprised at how easy it is to use contests to reach your marketing goals.

      <Title><![CDATA[Four Common Marketing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[The right marketing will bring more customers your way, but the wrong marketing will leave some great models sitting unsold in your lot. Don't make these four mistakes.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[Car buyers have many options and much to think about, and you want to make sure yours is the dealership they choose. The right marketing will bring more customers your way, but the wrong marketing will leave some great models sitting unsold in your lot. Don&amp;#39;t make these four mistakes.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Having No Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a certain budget for marketing, and the best way to waste it is to spend it on random ads and content schemes without a clear strategy in mind. Consider whether you&amp;#39;ll be doing the marketing yourself or hiring a company. Think about the sales goals you&amp;#39;re trying to achieve and make sure you communicate well with everyone working on the marketing. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a large operation. Even if you&amp;#39;re a small dealership, the right plan will give your marketing purpose and drive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lacking a Target Audience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your marketing depends on your audience. You wouldn&amp;#39;t try to sell a Corvette to a low-income family. Don&amp;#39;t make the mistake of marketing with such broad brush strokes that you don&amp;#39;t take into account your customers&amp;#39; lifestyles and desires. Got a great new SUV on the lot? Think about who buys your SUVs, and find creative ways to highlight that SUV&amp;#39;s features that will appeal to them. Narrow your net a little so you grab more attention from the people most likely to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Failing to See the Customer Point of View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have many points you want to hammer home about your dealership, and you want your product lineup to be front-and-center on your website and blog. But customers aren&amp;#39;t only visiting you to find out how much it is to lease their next car. They have questions and concerns, and part of how they trust you is your way of answering those questions and concerns. Do you have some feedback forum in which they can reach out and receive an answer? Customers don&amp;#39;t have the industry knowledge you do, and buying a car can be an overwhelming process. Being there when they have a question is a great way to gain trust and keep someone coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Releasing Uninformative Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your content has a lot to do with whether your customers are finding what they&amp;#39;re looking for when they visit your website and social media. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean you shouldn&amp;#39;t advertise your sales and the newest models on your lot. But intersperse that advertising with content marketing. Make sure your blog, newsletter, and Facebook are all updated regularly with content the customer will find valuable. Give tips about DIY car maintenance, make lists of common car concerns and when cars need maintenance, or create videos answering common customer questions. You might even want to make a video or an infographic about how to do simple maintenance tasks like changing windshield wiper blades. Reach your target audience with the right marketing to make them confident that their questions will be answered. A small marketing budget used the right way is better than a big one focusing on the wrong stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Four Incentives You Should Be Offering at Your Car Dealership]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[These incentives are so tantalizing, they're sure to help you reach your goals.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Toy-Car-1024x680&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/Toy-Car-1024x680.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 50%; height: 50%;&quot; /&gt;You&amp;#39;ve got exciting cars, helpful employees, and an attractive facility, so where are your customers? Unfortunately, those components aren&amp;#39;t enough to attract customers in today&amp;#39;s competitive market. If you&amp;#39;re looking to bring new customers to your car dealership and boost your customer retention levels, you&amp;#39;ll need some extra firepower on the marketing front. These incentives are so tantalizing, they&amp;#39;re sure to help you reach your goals.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make Test Drives More Tempting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;#39;s just a matter of getting customers into a new car that convinces them it&amp;#39;s time for an upgrade. Fortunately, getting more customers to take test drives is fairly simple. A promotion where every customer receives movie tickets, a gift card, or free snacks when they come in for a test drive is plenty. Plus, you shouldn&amp;#39;t have to shell out much cash for these special offers. Just partner with a local business to get the freebies you need at a discounted price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Be Mysterious&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to build buzz for your dealership if you use the right strategy. In fact, when done right, certain promotions can be more about the anticipation than the actual offer. The first step is to advertise in the weeks leading up to the promotion without revealing the special offer. All eyes will be on your business as the excitement builds, and it gives potential car-buyers time to think about making a big purchase. Then, do a big mystery reveal for the offer and announce the limited time for which it will be available. The options for your special promotion are endless. You can offer price discounts or special financing, but tangible items, such as free floor mats, stereo systems, or even cold hard cash, are typically more enticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let Your Customers Do the Talking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your current customers have many options when it comes to buying and servicing their cars. To make sure they pick you again, you need to reward them for their loyalty. Meanwhile, it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt to spread the word about your business. An easy way to boost sales while also focusing on customer retention is to offer referral incentives. If new customers make a purchase on their recommendation, they get a special perk, whether it&amp;#39;s a complimentary oil change or a free tank of gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Neglect Your Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto dealerships often focus on the flashiest forms of advertising, including everything from shouting spokespeople in television advertisements to big blow-up items on their lots. But what many fail to do is make their website an enticement to buyers. Not every potential customer will see your ad or drive by your dealership. However, most will research your inventory online before bothering to come in, so make sure you update it with your latest offers and incentives. One easy option: Get a discount on a new or used car when you mention our website. Use these tips and tricks to help meet your sales goals. With a little planning and clever strategy, your increased sales should make any cost you have to spend more than worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[How Employee Reviews Can Drive Your Dallas Dealership to the Top]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Paying careful attention to employee reviews may just be what drives your Dallas dealership to the top. Here's why.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;car-lot-1024x768&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/car-lot-1024x768.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 35%; height: 35%;&quot; /&gt;In any business, success relies heavily on customer satisfaction, and expanding your business can come largely from how customers express that satisfaction. Customer reviews can have a significant impact on how others view your business and whether or not they&amp;#39;re drawn to you or pushed away. Your customer perception of your employees also carries a significant weight on the perception of your business. Paying careful attention to employee reviews may just be what drives your Dallas dealership to the top. Here&amp;#39;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drawing Customers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, employee reviews will impact how likely potential customers are to consider visiting your dealership. Seventy percent of car buyers admit that online dealership reviews impact where they choose to purchase a vehicle. It&amp;#39;s intimidating enough to buy a car. Customers have plenty of things to worry about other than having to deal with a bad salesperson. Good employee reviews can alleviate that stress and help customers feel more comfortable. At the end of a customer&amp;#39;s visit to your dealership, consider asking them to complete an employee review online. Doing so will give potential customers the opportunity to see other customers&amp;#39; experience and give them an idea of what they&amp;#39;re in for at your dealership. Now that we&amp;#39;ve considered how employee reviews can boost your potential for customers, let&amp;#39;s consider how you can go about getting this process going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dealer Rater&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealerrater.com is a great resource for any dealership looking to provide customers with a simple and convenient place to leave reviews. The website allows customers to leave reviews for specific dealerships and their employees all across the nation. In a world revolving around the internet, it&amp;#39;s vital to have your name out there on the web, and these reviews will make your name a good, reliable name. Consider inviting customers to visit Dealer Rater and leave a review of their experience at your dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reviews will mean little if you and your employees do little else than invite your customers to leave one. Make sure that both you and your employees are aware of their reviews and look for new ones regularly. Reviews can act as a measurement by which employees can view and measure their improvement, skills, and skills they may need to further develop. Customers are looking for honest, personable salesmen that they can trust. Consider having your employees invite potential customers to look up their specific name either in Google or in an online review. This will cause potential customers to see the transparency and honesty of your employees and motivate them to trust and rely on their salesman. When making as big a decision as buying a car, customers want to feel that they can not only rely on whoever may be working with them, but they want to feel connected to them as well. They want to work with someone who is personable and relatable. Customers who view online reviews could already start to feel some amount of connection to your employees before they even come to the dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[How Twitter Can Shape Automotive Marketing]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[The ongoing discussion about vehicles happening on Twitter significantly increases during big sales events. ]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Phone-in-Hand-1024x6...&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/2/11/Phone-in-Hand-1024x683.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 50%; height: 50%;&quot; /&gt;The ongoing discussion about vehicles happening on Twitter significantly increases during big sales events. Year-end car sales, month-long promotions, and car shows can double and even triple the number of tweets focused on specific car makes and models. Dealers can hop in on these conversations with a few hashtags. Showcasing your dealership&amp;#39;s event, tweeting great pictures of the models on the lot, and interacting with people excited about the sale are great starting points.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tweets Indicate Intent to Buy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search for hashtags or specific terms on Twitter. When you use geolocation, these searches can target specific people in your area looking to buy a car. This is a great way to reach out to people who are in the market. Auto News reported that people who tweet about car buying are very likely to actually make a vehicle purchase within three days. So, you can actually use Twitter to find potential customers, and to send them messages that will get them interested in your dealership. If their tweets mention specific features, you can ask them questions about those features or about the cars they&amp;#39;re considering. If they aren&amp;#39;t specific, tweet them back and ask what they&amp;#39;re looking for. Don&amp;#39;t make it sound like a sales pitch, though. Instead, asking questions and giving honest information is the better way to connect with these potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Twitter Connects Dealers and Buyers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is an interesting marketing tool.&amp;nbsp;You aren&amp;#39;t limited to targeting people tweeting about buying a car. You only have 140 characters, so you can&amp;#39;t spend much time advertising with anything more than headlines. What you can do, however, is interact with your customers. Young buyers may not be willing to head to your contact page to fill out an e-mail form, but they just might tweet at you. Your dealership&amp;#39;s blog is for posting great content; use your Twitter to interact with people about their cars and car questions. Find out what people in your area are saying about the makes you sell, and don&amp;#39;t be afraid to interact with what they&amp;#39;re saying. If someone is having car trouble, point them to a resource on your blog (rather than suggesting a service appointment). You&amp;#39;re trying to create relationships that are more than just transactions. When using Twitter for marketing, remember not to make your interactions sound like sales pitches. Twitter is a place for conversation, not for doggedly pushing the new models on your lot. Don&amp;#39;t let this valuable way to connect with your customers and market your dealership bypass your notice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Four Incentives You Should Be Offering at Your Dallas Dealership]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Offering incentives, whether they are for purchasing a new vehicle or for returning for maintenance, is a solid way to show customer appreciation and build loyalty.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Dallas car buyers have many dealerships to choose from, which is why it&amp;#39;s important to make yours stand out. Marketing and advertising aren&amp;#39;t your only tools for bringing in new customers and retaining current customers. Offering incentives, whether they are for purchasing a new vehicle or for returning for maintenance, is a solid way to show customer appreciation and build loyalty.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Encourage Test Drives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get people to come into your dealership and look at vehicles by giving away something small for &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/bring-customers-auto-dealership-32737.html&quot;&gt;every test drive&lt;/a&gt;. A free movie ticket or a cup of designer coffee will draw people into your dealership. You don&amp;#39;t want it to be too expensive because you will pull in some people who are there just for the freebie. However, you&amp;#39;ll also get people who are genuinely interested in the cars you&amp;#39;re selling. Run this special offer for a set period to entice people to act now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Offer Referral Perks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of mouth is still a powerful marketing tool, so encourage your current customers to recommend your business by offering them perks for referrals. Offer a free tank of gas or money off their next service appointment for each new customer they refer. When you get a referral, make sure you thank the customer who referred the new business, too. Sending a note or a card in the mail is a wonderful way to let customers know you appreciate them. If a customer consistently sends you referrals, consider sending that customer a gift certificate to a popular Dallas restaurant or some free movie tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add Extras to Purchases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer fun extras with car purchases. One week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedshiftmedia.com/blog/how-to-create-an-offer-that-works-well-for-attracting-used-car-buyers&quot;&gt;do new floor mats&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who buys a used car. The next week, say the first oil change on a new vehicle is on the house. These incentives might seem small compared to such a large overall purchase, but sometimes, they can be enough to push people from &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; on a car. Extras can be a good way to target a certain market of car buyer, too. Offering mud flaps might bring in people who love to off-road, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create a Loyalty Program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every business nowadays offers some sort of loyalty program, and for good reason: they work. When customers know they&amp;#39;ll build up points or earn rewards for returning to the same place, they do. Once you&amp;#39;ve sold a car to someone, give them an incentive to return to your shop for maintenance. Offer a points system for work done, and once they hit a certain threshold reward them. Alternatively, if they come in for five oil changes, the sixth is free. People love to save money, so let customers know that if they keep returning, they will. People can be fiercely loyal to businesses when they&amp;#39;ve had a good experience. Make sure your incentives target both new and existing customers to continue to build your business and your reputation as a quality Dallas car dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I see the same pitfalls each time. We get a new client or prospective client asking us how to rank locally with multiple locations. After all, they only have one domain! How on earth could you associate multiple websites with one domain? Well just pay attention for once and I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multiple Location Pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look I optimized for all my locations! I have a page dedicated to all my locations with embedded google maps! Aren&amp;rsquo;t you proud of me?&amp;rdquo; NO! Granted it&amp;rsquo;s better than a large portion of websites, but still not nearly enough. By making a new page for every single location, we get new possibilities. With a new page we can target keywords specific to that location, we can have new schema code pointing to the specified location, and we can fit in &amp;ldquo;Contact Us&amp;rdquo; forms specific to that location in a way that is clean and keeps the page easy to navigate. Google now has a page that is directly associated with your customer&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;searches based on location&amp;nbsp;which can rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Major Listing pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a page to point to, we need to have things to do the pointing. This means that all of your new pages should have their own google my business page, Facebook page, Superpages, Bing, all of the ones that affect googles algorithm at the very least. Not only that but when these pages are made, they need to point to the new Location page that we made before. This lets&amp;nbsp;google easily recognize that these new location pages are separate locations on the map. Now we can start getting these locations into the map pack and get noticed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Extra Bits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous two paragraphs I would consider are required for any serious attempt at optimization for multiple locations. This last one is filled with the highly encouraged methods for improving optimization for these pages. Because you now have, ideally, multiple different pages ranking, you need to make these pages easy to navigate quickly. Keep the page clean and only with content that either drives click through traffic, or gives quick content that searchers are actively looking for. Also you should considering doing a small link building campaign for these new pages as well. These links will not only improve the page authority for each location, but raise overall domain authority. A quick and easy way is to use listing directories that let you link to your site for each and every location. It won&amp;rsquo;t take many links to make a difference. Lastly, consider encouraging customers to leave reviews for your locations. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be many, just enough to show&amp;nbsp;stars on google and apple maps (apple maps uses yelp for stars). Many people will not purchase a product or service without some sort of peer review. Hopefully this helps you understand my strategy for ranking with multiple locations on google. Bare&amp;nbsp;in mind that this strategy is from my personal understanding of how to rank for multiple locations and what has worked for me. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please leave a comment and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Using Sales-Based Analytics to Sell More Cars]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Learning more about this technology could make your dealership more profitable by increasing sales and helping you invest money wisely.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s dealerships have the advantage of using advanced software when making business decisions. Sales-based analytics offers a data-driven perspective that can give your dealership several advantages. Learning more about this technology could make your dealership more profitable by increasing sales and helping you invest money wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Find Out What Marketing Works Best&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cars are big business in the United States. In December 2015 alone, consumers purchased over 656,000 cars, 987,000 light duty trucks, and 622,000 crossover SUVs. Given the large interest in cars, it&amp;#39;s no wonder that cities have so many dealerships. Those dealerships, however, have to compete with each other to attract buyers. That&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do in such a crowded industry. Dealerships use a variety of marketing techniques to get potential buyers to their lots, but it&amp;#39;s difficult to tell which techniques work well. Sales-based analytics makes it easier for dealerships to determine whether their marketing worked or they just happened to have a few good weeks. Google Analytics lets marketers evaluate their campaigns so they know which ones are effective. If a certain keyword phrase brought 100,000 hits to the website, then it&amp;#39;s worth investing in rather than the keyword phrase that only brought in 10,000 hits. It&amp;#39;s also fairly easy to track conversions (the number of people who actually purchase products after visiting a website). When you compare your site&amp;#39;s activity with purchases made in the showroom, you can see trends pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Predict What Vehicles to Keep Stocked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few things are worse for a salesperson than letting a buyer go because you don&amp;#39;t have the right product. Instead of taking your commission to the bank, you watch a sale walk out the door. With sales-based analytics, dealerships can make informed predictions about which vehicles they need to keep in stock. If there has been an increase in convertible sales during the last two summers, then you can make a good guess that those sales will increase this summer, too. Without analytics, you&amp;#39;re just guessing about what people want to buy. When you have the data, you&amp;#39;re reasonably certain that you have the vehicles customers want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make the Most of Your Sales Staff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most dealership managers are savvy enough to know that there are certain times of the week or year when it&amp;#39;s best for people to buy cars. It isn&amp;#39;t a big secret that people who shop for cars during the workweek are likely to get better deals because the sales reps don&amp;#39;t have as many customers as during the weekend. What&amp;#39;s not often obvious is which salespersons are suitable for specific times. Joe might make great sales during the evening, but his numbers are pitiful when he works mornings. Angela might sell a ton of cars during the week, but it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible for her to make a deal on a Monday. Sales-based analytics makes it easier to see when you schedule employees to get the most out of their unique talents. More and more dealerships are realizing the benefits of sales-based analytics. If you aren&amp;#39;t using this technology, then there&amp;#39;s a good chance you&amp;#39;re already falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[How to Market a New Sports Franchise]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[When the opportunity to become part owner of a new Ultimate Frisbee franchise in DFW came up, I bought in without thinking about the countless issues I would have to face.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;m not very organized. &amp;nbsp;Just ask my co-workers or my wife. &amp;nbsp;So when the opportunity to become part owner of a new Ultimate Frisbee franchise in DFW came up, I bought in without thinking about the repercussions. &amp;nbsp;Below are some problems we ran into and the solutions which are a work in progress.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Problem #1:&lt;b&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t know what we didn&amp;rsquo;t know. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theaudl.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The AUDL&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; American Ultimate Disc League is only three years old and there&amp;rsquo;s no template on what needs to be done to be successful. &amp;nbsp;Every team acts individually with a monthly owners call. &lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Solution #1: Ask what works from the successful owners. &amp;nbsp;Listen to them and take what they know to your team. &amp;nbsp;One thing was obvious from our discussions; we need to sell beer at the games to have a chance at being profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Problem #2 Leadership needs to be clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Solution #2 Once defined, the leaders/managers need to be given the autonomy to make decisions quickly. &amp;nbsp;This is true for any business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Problem #3: &amp;nbsp;There are too many projects and not enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Solution #3: &amp;nbsp;Delegate. &amp;nbsp;Once you begin to understand what&amp;rsquo;s got to be done, it can be overwhelming. &amp;nbsp;If you say you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time, you haven&amp;rsquo;t delegated it yet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Problem #4 &amp;nbsp;How do you promote an obscure sport to the number 5 market in the US with a limited budget? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Solution #4: As I write this, we are beginning this process. &amp;nbsp;The home opener is April 2nd at the Five Star Complex in The Colony. &amp;nbsp;You should come. &amp;nbsp;We are behind the eight ball when it&amp;rsquo;s coming to sponsorship ad promoting so I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you what works but can let you know the plans. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have a three prong approach - Sponsors, Media and the PTA. &amp;nbsp;Yep, I said the PTA. &amp;nbsp;Another profitable franchise (The Madison Radicals) brought this up in a call and we are beginning to work it. &amp;nbsp;Basically what we can do is come out to their schools and give a clinic to the kids. &amp;nbsp;Along with that we give a block of tickets to the PTA moms and tell them for every ticket they sell, we will give back $2. &amp;nbsp;Simple and I hope effective. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sponsorships are incentivized as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not only are the owners working our contacts, we have incentivized the players 5% of any sponsor that signs up. &amp;nbsp;Stay tuned on this. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The promotion via media may sound very hard, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of what we are doing is not newsworthy to the editor sitting at his desk in at the local TV station. &amp;nbsp;Same thing we always run into. No one knows what Ultimate Frisbee is. &amp;nbsp;But we have an ace in the hole. &amp;nbsp;Not only have we accumulated the best players in the Ultimate world on our team, two of the players are currently on The Amazing Race. &amp;nbsp;Leave it to reality TV to come through. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s at least good for something! &amp;nbsp;If nothing else, we should be able to get the CBS affiliate to do an interview. &amp;nbsp;We will also be hitting up our agency&amp;rsquo;s local reps and calling in favors as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Oh, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dallasroughnecks.com/tickets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dallas Roughnecks&lt;/a&gt; will be the front runner in every game they play. &amp;nbsp;We are shaking up the ultimate community by bringing in the top talent. &amp;nbsp;So we are the New York Yankees, Dallas Cowboys and Manchester United of the AUDL. &amp;nbsp;You can love us or hate us - I don&amp;rsquo;t care. &amp;nbsp;Just show up to the games, buy a beer and some merchandise, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And you get the added benefit of witnessing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLL-qDHd5o5ucOiQHReKL7QKIjkJvNkSwS&amp;amp;v=Uc9RkIP06hU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;best the sport has to offer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[When I became a mother to two girls, I became acutely aware of the subtle message so many commercials and toys and clothes were sending to girls.  ]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a mom of 2 girls, and I am the CFO at Miller Ad Agency.&amp;nbsp; My mother started this company over 30 years ago.&amp;nbsp; Growing up in the Advertising world, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen (and even cameo-ed in) a LOT of commercials.&amp;nbsp; But when I became a mother to two girls, I became acutely aware of the subtle message so many commercials and toys and clothes were sending to girls.&amp;nbsp; Even today, in 2016, you will still find major advertisers subtly hinting that men make the money &amp;ndash; women do the homemaking.&amp;nbsp; Now, that is all fine and good for whoever chooses to run their household that way.&amp;nbsp; Women are free to do anything in America, including stay home and run the household, and I have many amazingly brilliant friends who choose to do just that.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;ll also be very proud of my girls if that is the path they choose to take.&amp;nbsp; But in the photo-shop, Kardashian world we live in, I want to be very sure that they know girls can do ANYTHING.&amp;nbsp; Which is why I am so thrilled with Barbie&amp;rsquo;s new campaign.&amp;nbsp; As some of you may remember, Barbie ran into quite the controversy (rightly so, in my opinion), with their &amp;ldquo;Math is hard.&amp;nbsp; Shopping&amp;rsquo;s fun!&amp;rdquo; talking Barbie.&amp;nbsp; Good grief.&amp;nbsp; Definitely not the message I want my daughters to hear.&amp;nbsp; (Shopping IS fun, but so is math.)&amp;nbsp; But they have worked hard to repair their reputation with their new campaign &amp;ldquo;Imagine the Possibilities&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, it shows young girls pretending to be professors, veterinarians, business women.&amp;nbsp; Is this commercial for kids? No.&amp;nbsp; It is for the adults who buy the barbies.&amp;nbsp; It is to convince us (especially moms) that Barbie is more than an impossibly tall, thin blonde who runs around after Ken.&amp;nbsp; She is anything you want her to be.&amp;nbsp; Bravo Barbie.&amp;nbsp; You have won a fan back by listening to your customers, even if it took you a while.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I was endeavoring to explain to a friend today, in answer to his question, &amp;ldquo;What do you think of Trump?&amp;rdquo;, that I thought he (Trump) had a few core tenants of marketing perfectly wired. Leave it to a marketing guy to try to answer every question by citing GREAT marketing chops! Let&amp;rsquo;s first lay the ground work with an analogy or at least point of reference to one of the strongest marketing campaigns of all time by the folks at Band Aid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know why I&amp;rsquo;m stuck on Band Aid? &amp;lsquo;Cause Band Aid is stuck on me! Their jingle, the repetition and the singular focus (or&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;distillation&lt;/u&gt;) around a single stake in the ground makes for incredibly strong branding and recall. Name another kind of bandage? &amp;nbsp;(Picture me humming the Jeopardy there as you struggle throughout this moment).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jingles- They work. We remember songs better than spoken word. Remember the alphabet? Try saying it&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;the song, see how you do.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repetition- As my golf coach likes to say, practice makes permanent. The more we see something the&amp;nbsp;better we remember it, but MORE importantly the more we like it. Familiarity breeds LIKE. It&amp;rsquo;s why we can&amp;rsquo;t break habits, why we stay in abusive relationships. We like the routine. I am stuck on Band Aid&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Singular Focus- Band Aid hammers home the word STUCK. Every message is better when&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;distilled&lt;/u&gt;. Like a fine vodka or bourbon, the focusing of flavors that &amp;nbsp;occurs in the distillation process (or aging, aka consistency building process) makes a spirit stand out in an ocean of fermented potatoes and corn. Messaging requires distillation. Say in it 30 seconds, now say it in 15. Now explain it to Grandma in 10&amp;hellip;better have a singular focus, great and recognizable flavor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catch the commercial and then we&amp;rsquo;re going to switch gears to El Trumpo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxgBXJM6zJ8&quot; width=&quot;420&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the deal. You heard it here first. He distilled himself 7x (like a fine vodka) to represent &amp;nbsp;TOUGH. Trump is tough, or at least blustery until he actually comes to blow with a crazy rally-disrupter, so we can assume he is tough, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOUGH=&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough on trade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough on immigration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough on ISIS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough on his opponents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough on everything (except women, but that is up for much debate, right?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is fully distilled, and therefore #winning. Are you, is your brand, fully distilled???&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[A New Way to Approach Link Building]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[I felt like there was a noticeable lack of in depth information and examples for link building on the internet. With that in mind, I am going to go over what I have found works based on some experience, research, and successful execution.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;When I was first training in SEO, I was taught white hat, industry standard methods for everything. Content was always user friendly with no unnecessary keyword stuffing. However one method I always questioned was our link building strategies. Using third party software we would crawl directory listings that are most relevant to our particular website, and try to add them. None of these resources drive traffic, none of them would have high domain authority, and submitting them to the website was always a tedious and often unsuccessful task. After a bit of research using sites such as Moz, I began learning best practices most SEO consultants; however I felt like there was a noticeable lack of in depth information and examples. With that in mind, I am going to go over what I have found works based on some experience, research, and successful execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Start with What You Know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links are considered the highways of the internet while websites are the cities and towns, so make sure you can drive between all your cities. To start, any and all websites associated with your business need to link to one another. These links are completely free, yet people often don&amp;rsquo;t think to take them. Not only will this help with both domains&amp;rsquo; authority, but people may be interested with related businesses and click through. An easy way of doing this is making a page dedicated to informing visitors of all of your related businesses with a link to their domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Receive some Goodwill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that all of your domains are connected, you can start asking for links from anybody you spend money with. Whether that is vendors for your business or partners whom you trade services and supplies, these contacts should be more than happy to keep their customer happy. Now because most businesses you contact like this will not be as knowledgeable in SEO as you, so make sure to give them as much direction as possible. The only real requirement is that the link is on a page that is in the site map so it can be crawled by search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time to Reach Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to create links with the intent for them to be clicked through. These links are very valuable and you would be hard pressed to find someone willing to give these up without something in return. However, google will penalize you if they find out you are paying for links, so you need to get creative with the resources you use. Instead of buying links try sponsoring a charity or local organization, then ask for a link out of good faith. Try collaborating with popular bogs associated with your business and posting on them as a guest while linking to your site. Finally, discuss exchanging links with businesses you tend to work closely with. By using such resources as information, man hours, and other links, we can work together to become more successful in search engine optimization!&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Advertising in the digital age has opened the possibility for clients and designers to explore unfathomable amounts of creative avenues pertaining to projects. From type-heavy print layouts in Adobe InDesign to crafts of beauty in Adobe Illustrator &amp;ndash; each passing day it becomes easier to evolve your vision into production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prime example of today&amp;rsquo;s innovational brilliance stands out in the form of photomanipulation, or photo-illustration: the concept of taking multiple images and blending them all into a new single and seamless form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of photographical doctoring has been around since before the digital age; famous examples include the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_images_in_the_Soviet_Union#Censorship_of_historical_photographs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo of Joseph Stalin with his water commissar, Nikolai Yezhov (1)&lt;/a&gt;. After Yezhov had fallen from his position, censors akin to Winston Smith, George Orwell&amp;rsquo;s editor protagonist in the novel 1984, erased him from both life and history. Before computers, this type of alteration was achieved through forms ink, paint, and piecing together negatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have Adobe Photoshop, which provides us the tools to make the modifications we desire with ease. This feeds creative designers, and respective clients, with a plethora of opportunities to sell the perfect message with the perfect key art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;VW Advertisements&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/3/29/image2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steiner Creative, a Los Angeles agency couple, designed this appealing image for the auto company, Volkswagen. It drove home their advertising message with a single, inventive image that almost all can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a prime example of what photomanipulation can do for promotional purposes. It can capture, mold, and deliver a clever scene fit to the message at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Ars Thanea&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/3/29/image3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovery Networks CEEMEA hired the Polish advertising agency, &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.arsthanea.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ars Thanea&lt;/a&gt;, to ,&amp;rdquo; create a campaign to promote spring programming in one of their top portfolio brands - Discovery Channel. In the TV show roster the highlight was put on &amp;#39;Dynamo The Magician&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Bearing Sea Gold Rush&amp;#39; and new season of &amp;#39;Storm Chasers&amp;#39;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Ars Thanea crafted a magical piece of key art by combining the three highlight shows into a single illustration that evokes visual excitement and intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Photomanipulation&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/3/29/image4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its advert function, this technique can also be used to simply create alluring artwork; fun, quirky, breathtaking, interesting pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photomanipulation can breathe life into a sales initiative and push the messaging directive into the minds of viewers through its provocative display of imaging mastery. I highly suggest considering this venture for your next campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Truth in Advertising]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;What is the duty of an Advertiser? That in itself is a very thought-provoking question. The obvious answer is: To portray a product or service in a positive light as to convince consumers to purchase said product or service, as well as build consumer confidence in order to create brand loyalty for our clients. And, we would be doing a disservice to our clients by not working to our full capabilities to boost their success. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is true, but at what cost to the safety of the public? Do we not also owe the consumer the right to enjoy these abundant commodities without fear of negative repercussions to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our modern technological world we are bombarded by a constant stream of information/disinformation. Realistically, we are being advertised to from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep, sometimes without even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with that said, the unknown duty of an Advertiser is to make sure that those messages are disseminated with care. We must all take responsibility in the messages we create. Besides, nobody likes being lied to. It just seems to make more sense that if a consumer trusts that your client&amp;rsquo;s product/service won&amp;rsquo;t harm them or their family, and actually provides a positive experience, then said consumer would be more likely to choose your client&amp;rsquo;s brand in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, by offering a product/service that has no usefulness, or worse, could threaten the safety of consumers, you do nothing but alienate your target market and potentially put your company in financial or legal jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the old adage goes: &amp;ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&amp;rdquo; As an industry it is our duty to correct the more dishonest business practices some of our less trustworthy forefathers implemented before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;rsquo;t misunderstand me. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that we should forego creativity in order to do right by our clients. Creativity is not the issue (unless the creative idea itself is an outright lie), deception is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising not only has the ability to help strengthen Capitalism, it is a powerful foundation to inform and enlighten the masses. With so many advances in technology, and so many more people hearing our messages than ever before, our industry now has the best chance to make a positive impact on future generations. Through better buying habits Advertising can be the catalyst of change this world needs, and it all starts with a better message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will yours be?&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;What is the duty of an Advertiser? That in itself is a very thought-provoking question. The obvious answer is: To portray a product or service in a positive light as to convince consumers to purchase said product or service, as well as build consumer confidence in order to create brand loyalty for our clients. And, we would be doing a disservice to our clients by not working to our full capabilities to boost their success. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is true, but at what cost to the safety of the public? Do we not also owe the consumer the right to enjoy these abundant commodities without fear of negative repercussions to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our modern technological world we are bombarded by a constant stream of information/disinformation. Realistically, we are being advertised to from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep, sometimes without even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with that said, the unknown duty of an Advertiser is to make sure that those messages are disseminated with care. We must all take responsibility in the messages we create. Besides, nobody likes being lied to. It just seems to make more sense that if a consumer trusts that your client&amp;rsquo;s product/service won&amp;rsquo;t harm them or their family, and actually provides a positive experience, then said consumer would be more likely to choose your client&amp;rsquo;s brand in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, by offering a product/service that has no usefulness, or worse, could threaten the safety of consumers, you do nothing but alienate your target market and potentially put your company in financial or legal jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the old adage goes: &amp;ldquo;Honesty is the best policy.&amp;rdquo; As an industry it is our duty to correct the more dishonest business practices some of our less trustworthy forefathers implemented before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;rsquo;t misunderstand me. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that we should forego creativity in order to do right by our clients. Creativity is not the issue (unless the creative idea itself is an outright lie), deception is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising not only has the ability to help strengthen Capitalism, it is a powerful foundation to inform and enlighten the masses. With so many advances in technology, and so many more people hearing our messages than ever before, our industry now has the best chance to make a positive impact on future generations. Through better buying habits Advertising can be the catalyst of change this world needs, and it all starts with a better message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will yours be?&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The United States is, by far, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statista.com/statistics/273736/advertising-expenditure-in-the-worlds-largest-ad-markets/&quot;&gt;largest advertising market in the world&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, more than 180 billion dollars were spent on advertising in the United States. This amount is more than double the amount spent on advertising in China, the second largest advertising market in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is, if you are advertising within the United States (since you are reading a blog from a Texas ad agency, we&amp;rsquo;ll assume you are) then you are fighting a seemingly insurmountable battle on the world&amp;rsquo;s largest advertising stage. The battle for &lt;strong&gt;brand loyalty&lt;/strong&gt; amongst the American consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting your company to the top of the brand awareness totem pole can be daunting (mostly because the market is flooded with advertising giants that have reigned supreme for years like Coca-Cola, Apple, Nike, and Frito-Lay, just to name a few) but remember, the leaders of the pack had to start at the bottom too. There is hope, but getting there requires the proper strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is: Your brand is not your logo, your name, your website, or even your product (yep, you read that correctly). Your brand is in the intangibles, the emotions created by the consumer when they use your product or see your television commercials. It&amp;rsquo;s how your brand makes them &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, humans are emotional creatures, and many of our daily decisions (including purchasing decisions) are guided by our personal feelings and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is: What are the key ingredients in the recipe for a successful branding strategy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few factors to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Motivation- As in, &amp;ldquo;What is your company&amp;rsquo;s motivation and drive? Why do you do what you do?&amp;rdquo; Yes, all companies promise some sort of benefit (These shoes will make you run faster. This particular brand of yogurt will make you healthier. This brand of tire&amp;rsquo;s tread won&amp;rsquo;t wear down as fast. And so on and so forth.) but that&amp;rsquo;s not always enough. What specifically differentiates your company from your competitors?Many times a company&amp;rsquo;s purpose can be broken down to two key elements: Purpose of Function, and Purpose of Intention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Function- The evaluation viewed in terms of immediate and commercial success (i.e the purpose of your business is strictly to make money). This one doesn&amp;rsquo;t always go over so well with consumers. Yes, they know you are a business and businesses have to make money to exist, but most people don&amp;rsquo;t like being seen as walking dollar signs.Which brings&amp;nbsp;us to the more human element &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Intention- The concept of growing the financial success of your business while (and this is the important part) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;doing some good in the world for your fellow man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of Intentional Purpose in advertising is IKEA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;IKEA vision 1&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/4/21/IKEA-vision-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;better everyday life&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them&amp;rdquo; a better emotional strategy than &amp;ldquo;At (insert company here) we like to make money so we can afford to buy our third yacht&amp;rdquo;? I think so, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure most consumers would agree with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Consistency- The trick to staying consistent in your messaging is to stay away from images or messages that don&amp;rsquo;t relate to or enrich your brand.&amp;nbsp;Ask yourself: &amp;ldquo;Is this meme I just posted to Instagram a good representation of the overall message I&amp;rsquo;m trying to send about my product and its value, or is it just humor for humor&amp;rsquo;s sake?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;Sending inconsistent messages about your product/service can be confusing to your target audience, and could potentially destroy any credibility you may have gained with consumers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Emotion- As I stated earlier, humans are emotional creatures, and more times than not, follow a group mentality. They just want to be part of the &amp;ldquo;in-crowd.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s why a person might make a decision to buy a more popular brand, even if it&amp;rsquo;s more expensive. For example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Harley 2&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/4/21/Harley-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By giving motorcycle enthusiasts an opportunity to be part of a larger group, Harley- Davidson has positioned themselves as the clear choice for someone looking to purchase a motorcycle. Now, they don&amp;rsquo;t just have to &amp;ldquo;keep up with the Joneses,&amp;rdquo; they can join them for a leisurely Sunday ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:.5in;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Flexibility- Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve found your emotional approach, focus on the best way to expand your idea to reach new audiences. Vary your approach to keep an original idea from becoming stagnant. Never rest on your laurels. Learn to listen to your audience&amp;rsquo;s needs and wants, and adapt accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Employee Involvement- Make sure your brand is being represented cohesively from top to bottom. We live in a social and digital age. Use it to your advantage. Set up events so that your executives and employees can be seen enjoying your product/service. If you won&amp;rsquo;t use your own product, then how can you expect John Q. Public to trust that your product represents them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, last but certainly not least:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li value=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Loyalty- The best thing you can do is to show appreciation for those who have helped in your success. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;gratitude.&amp;rdquo; Reward loyal customers for being loyal. These people have gone out of their way to give your product/service good reviews on the Internet (trust me, people look at those, and sometimes base their purchasing decisions on them), they tell their friends and family (after all, word-of-mouth is really the best advertising), they act as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;brand ambassadors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Biting the hand that feeds is the absolute best way to alienate a loyal customer base. People enjoy being appreciated. Never forget that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now that you have your branding arsenal equipped, go out and prepare for battle. You are ready.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Social Media’s Influence on Politics]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Today’s political campaigns are not your grandfather’s campaigns, or even your father’s campaigns. Gone are the days when people had to turn on the nightly news to find out what their favorite candidate was up to that day.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s political campaigns are not your grandfather&amp;rsquo;s campaigns, or even your father&amp;rsquo;s campaigns. Gone are the days when people had to turn on the nightly news to find out what their favorite candidate was up to that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when Americans had to show up in person at a rally or town hall meeting to offer words of support to their candidate. Gone are the days when candidates had to rely solely on TV, radio, or newspaper ads to spread their message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media has changed the world of political campaigning by allowing direct contact with the candidates. Campaigns have become busy two-way streets whereby candidates and potential voters have constant access to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using avenues such as Facebook and Twitter, candidates can communicate with their supporters any time of day. They don&amp;rsquo;t need to rely on direct mail packages every few weeks to try and build support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important aspect of this is social media gives candidates&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;access to voters at &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; time. With social media, there is no need for the news media to serve as the middle man, filtering the candidate&amp;rsquo;s message however they want. Candidates don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about distortion when one of their staffers is tweeting or posting messages directly to a platform where their supporters can see it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not only do candidates have unrestricted access to their supporters, but supporters have access to the candidates and campaigns as well. The average American can use Twitter to communicate with their favorite candidate directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of Facebook, where ordinary people can immediately comment on whatever information the campaign shares. There is no need to write a letter and send it in the snail mail anymore. We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a social media strategy has become a major priority for the modern political campaign. With social media sites often getting more traffic than an official campaign website, it&amp;rsquo;s important for candidates to have a media presence on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, President Obama was the first candidate to really harness the power and influence of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama&amp;rsquo;s campaign understood and leveraged social media similar to how the Kennedy campaign capitalized on first televised campaign debate in 1960, between then-presidential candidates John Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Americans who saw the debate on television thought Kennedy had won while those who heard it on radio thought Nixon had a better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Kennedy and Obama were able to use a new communication medium to galvanize support. &amp;nbsp;In 2012, Obama took his social media campaign to the next level by joining Twitter and conducting chats on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media has fundamentally changed the way Americans follow politics. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/politics-fact-sheet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pew Research Center,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;66% of social media users (39% of American adults) have engaged in civic or political activities with social media. It is undeniable social media is not only important, but it is critical to the success of a political campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political campaigns create politicians creating interesting posts to try to engage followers. Candidates try to come up with memorable and simple posts that can be easily shared or retweeted. The objective is to create content that will continue to fuel interest in their candidacies and help them reach fundraising goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaigns may have learned to harness social media, but it&amp;rsquo;s not just a tool for political campaigns. Politically savvy friends and family are influencing less politically educated people using their social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people rely on the posts of their more knowledgeable friends to keep up to date on politics and current events. The political posts shared on social media are constantly influencing public opinion, and savvy political campaigns understand the power of this type of group thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is a good thing for democracy. Anyone can share their views on their Facebook or Twitter page and feel empowered and part of the political process. With that said, there is conflicting data on the effect of social media on voting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the International Weekly Journal of Science, people turned out to vote after seeing a message on Facebook. In contrast,&amp;nbsp;The Washington Post noted young people in particular didn&amp;rsquo;t vote in greater numbers in the 2014 midterms, despite being active on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is conflicting, but one thing is certain; social media has changed the political game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;This title should bring a few things to mind like either a bad new car, a milk ad campaign, or of course Lemonade. The difference is now Lemonade has an entirely new meaning. It was simply a phrase, a metaphor that reminded people to turn something bad into something positive: lemons into lemonade. But all because of Beyonc&amp;eacute;-now that phrase will forever have a new meaning and a place in the marketing lexicon&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Beyonc&amp;eacute; release her new album in monumental fashion with a video version on HBO. The point of this thought is not to review if the story is about her relationship or her dad, if it is real or not, and of course the all-important who Becky with the good hair is. The point is about the perception; the perception is that it was a real outpouring of emotion and of course that got full attention of not just the Bee Hive (loyal Beyonc&amp;eacute; fans), but casual fans alike. In fact coverage of the topic even made the national news. This isn&amp;rsquo;t an album that caused political outcry like Purple Rain by Prince, this is just an album that is possibly about a famous person&amp;rsquo;s relationship. And because of the power of that window opening, Beyonc&amp;eacute; was able to cause a marketing coup. She only released her album in one place, a streaming source called Tidal (partially owned by Beyonc&amp;eacute;&amp;rsquo;s husband Jay-Z and coincidentally the suspected topic of the album). The streaming platform has experienced a major surge in downloads of the app since the release of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So what can we learn from the Queen B herself. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to the old adage that there is no such thing as bad publicity. So when your business or product experience negativity, bad press, or turns out to be a lemon, then you should always make lemonade. Find a way to put a spin on the topic or item and release the information in a very creative way. I do think Beyonc&amp;eacute; found the magic mix between message and platform, but that is usually available to all marketers. All that is required is some simple research of the listener/customer as well as the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Companies like Volkswagen should take a page from Lemonade when they finally address the cheating on emissions tests in the US. It would be interesting to see if the follow the pattern of being open and transparent while also placing the message in the right medium for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;lot of companies can follow the leader and let Queen Beyonc&amp;eacute; be the director of a platform that rebrands a product or a company. Soon there will be lemonade flowing every where you turn!&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[Here I will summarize the current state of one of the most popular and influential social networks currently making waves in cyber space.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The undeniable presence of social media in today&amp;rsquo;s digital landscape continues to change the way we use the Internet, interact with each other, and experience advertising messages. Social Media has transcended the confines of the millennial audience pushing out to a wider variety of ages and cultures with each passing year. Here I will summarize the current state of one of the most popular and influential social networks currently making waves in cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the blue corner weighing in at 1.32 billion active users is the titan of social networks, Facebook. These days you would be hard-pressed to find someone who is not an active Facebook user; in the beginning Facebook was for college students primarily but has now grown to have adults age 35-54 as the largest age group of users. Enter 2016, the beginning of true digital dominance in the Advertising Industry, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg has laid out a bold new plan for the already dominating social network. The Messenger Platform that works through Facebook is getting an upgrade in the form of automated bots. These chatbots are able to walk you through making online purchases as well as getting the weather forecast, keeping up with current events and more, all without having to leave Facebook Messenger. Some are complaining that the bots are creating spam in Messenger and there seem to be bugs that need addressing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As technology continues to advance and shape the world no frontier is left untouched, this rings true for Facebook also as it has also been revealed that they hope to make group hangouts through virtual reality a common occurrence. Imagine being able to interact with friends from other states and even countries face-to-face in a virtual realm, where Zuckerberg also intends to implement touch controls that would theoretically allow you to reach out and &amp;ldquo;touch&amp;rdquo; others in said virtual space. Facebook is developing more sophisticated 360 degree cameras to further facilitate Facebook&amp;rsquo;s virtual reality involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 will yield many more changes to the ever evolving social media landscape and Facebook will no doubt be at the center of it all. Advertising opportunities will increase, new content will arise, and the total number of users will likely to grow to largest size so far.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[There’s more to auto dealer advertising than screaming commercials.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to auto dealer advertising than screaming commercials. Unfortunately when sales slow down, hard sell advertising normally kicks in giving the dealer a quick boost in sales. Finding a balance between the immediate gratification of hard sell advertising and long term branding is difficult for most dealers. Which is understandable when you&amp;rsquo;re looking at your monthly expenses versus your monthly gross profit, but branding your dealership is the only way to build for the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future success start with finding your voice, a voice that reflects the personality of your dealership. Are you hard sale all the time, do you follow all the rules, do you like taking chances, is customer satisfaction really important to you? Didn&amp;rsquo;t know your dealership had a personality? Your customer and former customers assign personality traits to your dealership. Trustworthy, Caring, Crooks, High Pressure, Fair&amp;hellip;. So start defining your dealership&amp;rsquo;s personality and from that a branding voice will emerge that can carry your advertising message today and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Millennials Want More Than Ads]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[ In previous generations, the logic of marketing was that more the number of advertisements you throw at youngsters, the sooner you could hook them to your brand. During those times, this approach actually made some sense, but now, reaching out to the younger generation takes a lot more than traditional ads.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As generations keep changing, the nature of advertisement and media is also changing. In previous generations, the logic of marketing was that more the number of advertisements you throw at youngsters, the sooner you could hook them to your brand. During those times, this approach actually made some sense, but now, reaching out to the younger generation takes a lot more than traditional ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In particular, the millennials (born from early 80&amp;rsquo;s to around 2000) prove to be a challenge for the market and you can see numerous companies attempting to connect with them to seek personal, deep, and long-lasting relationships. Today, they are more like digital natives who are hooked on to their tablets, smartphones, and laptops. The goal for most marketers today is to reach out to millennials in the best ways so they can get loyalty, attention and ultimately make profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Best Advertising Strategies to Target Millennials&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Timing and location is crucial when getting the message across to millennials about your brand. If your business is the sort that wishes to target this heavy group, you must be aware of the fact that millennials spend most of their time on the internet. That&amp;rsquo;s where you can target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Social Media&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With the internet common in the present century, it isn&amp;rsquo;t anything new to see that millennials depend on social media sites. The more information they find on social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and many others, the more they tend to trust and act on that information. In other words, social media for advertisers can serve as one of the best places to target millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Internet Content Matters&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Another good strategy to reach millennials is through content. Marketers these days invest a lot of their time putting their message across to youngsters via content. In a recent survey, as much as 62 percent of millennials agreed that they read or watch a majority of their content online via social media and different websites. &amp;nbsp;By content, this could include articles, blogs, and other various web-based postings. When millennials read content online, they tend to relate more and somehow trust it more than watching or listening to ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Millennials Depend On Reviews Not Ads&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In previous generations, people would simply watch ads on the television and their loyalty to the brand was a guarantee. Today, things have changed drastically and millennials tend to depend more on the reviews of products they see on the internet. &amp;nbsp;Meaning, investments in social media and reputation management are more important now than ever to the young buyers of today. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s also not about how the product appears on television, but how it can affect their life. They need to see proof that what you offer them can actually have an impact on their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Millennials Focus on Specific Categories&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Many researches also reveal that although millennials are tech advanced, there are some things that just don&amp;rsquo;t change. In terms of categories, male millennials still search for tech based gadgets and sports content while female millennials still focus on beauty and health aids. Keeping these traditions in mind, businesses should continue to work on displaying their services or products in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Authenticity and guarantee of advertising comes when you speak to and perceive millennials in the way they wish to be seen or viewed. You have to cultivate an authentic relationship and soon you can reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[The 5 Auto Shopping Moments You Need to Win]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[New prospects are insisting on authentic video reviews!]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;According to Google, there are 5 &amp;quot;moments&amp;quot; in auto shopping. These moments are when shoppers make a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;decision&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;about these critical requirements before they purchase. These moments determine what they will consider and where they want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHICH CAR IS BEST?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research reveals shoppers are most influenced by customer reviews and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;prefer watching videos&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to inform their buying process. Customers know exactly why they believe their vehicle is the best and can share their shopping experiences with current shoppers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS IT RIGHT FOR ME?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video usage ranks highly at this stage. The top types of videos auto shoppers search for include vehicle&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;test drives&lt;/strong&gt;, highlights of&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;features and options&lt;/strong&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;walkthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the interior or exterior of the vehicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN I AFFORD IT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says, &amp;quot;Once consumers can imagine owning a particular vehicle, they need to know if they can afford it. Also, for many shoppers, the value of their current car is just as important as the price of the new one.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO SHOULD I BUY FROM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy customers not only know and trust their dealership,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;they&amp;#39;re willing to tell others&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because they often feel a debt of gratitude towards the dealership and their salesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS IT A FAIR DEAL?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a store operates with transparency and salespeople create relationships based on trust,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;buyers relax and focus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;on getting what they want. Nothing says, &amp;quot;I got a fair deal&amp;quot; like being happy with your purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is it critical that dealers strive to own these 5 moments? Because the average car shopper today makes less than two dealership visits before they buy. That&amp;#39;s why you need customer videos to help them decide to visit your store&amp;nbsp;first. It&amp;#39;s one thing to promise a great customer experience, now you can prove it with customer videos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[It all starts with a smile.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As a Mom/Cheer Coach/Office Manager, I cannot count the times I have said &amp;ldquo;fake it &amp;lsquo;til you make it&amp;rdquo; to my &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes they just &amp;ldquo;aren&amp;rsquo;t feeling it&amp;rdquo; and need a quick attitude adjustment.&amp;nbsp; That is when I step in say the magical phrase that reminds them to make a conscious choice to &amp;ldquo;pretend&amp;rdquo; until it becomes &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; It all starts with a smile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe smiling is crucial when answering the phone. &amp;nbsp;People can hear a smile or frump through the phone.&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The reason is not psychological but rather physiological.&amp;nbsp; When you smile, the soft palate at the back of your mouth raises and makes the sound waves more fluid and helps your voice to sound friendly, warm, and receptive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many times we are distracted and answer the phone without consciously thinking and putting a smile on our face.&amp;nbsp; This can be a costly mistake.&amp;nbsp; For example, if a potential client calls and is greeted by a frumpy monotone voice, it will translate negatively and does not instill immediate confidence in you or your company. If a coworker calls your extension and you answer without smiling, it can give the impression that they are irritating you or annoying you with their call - which may or may not be true - but it is definitely not acceptable behavior in a professional work environment and can affect the all-around culture of a company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when you greet a potential client on the phone with a literal smile on your face, you exude confidence; you make them feel like they are important to you and that they can trust you.&amp;nbsp; A call answered with a smile by a coworker can change the attitude of the caller in an instant and can make a much more positive work environment.&amp;nbsp; Zappos.com gets it.&amp;nbsp; If you call and hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo3sMaH-h9Mv&quot;&gt;this &lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- how can you keep from smiling back?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some telemarketing companies are so convinced of the value of smiling when talking on the phone that they install mirrors above telemarketers&amp;#39; desks to remind them to smile.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;I would add that a strategically placed mirror would also relieve the stress of your coworkers having to tell you when you have erroneous food items stuck in your teeth, but I digress&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, fake it &amp;lsquo;til you make it, put a smile on your face/ in your voice and make the world a better place, one smile at a time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[“What’s the best use of my ad budget?”]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[I get this question quite a bit and it’s definitely changed over the years.  In fact, it’s different every time I get it asked to me.  My refrain is this, ‘If it was my marketing budget, what would I do?’]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I get this question quite a bit and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely changed over the years.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s different every time I get it asked to me.&amp;nbsp; My refrain is this, &amp;lsquo;If it was my marketing budget, what would I do?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this comes with the assumption that I know YOUR marketplace.&amp;nbsp; And that&amp;rsquo;s a big if.&amp;nbsp; I see a lot of vendors that sell one or two of the following; SEM, SEO, video, creative, email&amp;rsquo;s or traditional media.&amp;nbsp; But how much do they know a client&amp;rsquo;s market?&amp;nbsp; If they sell online attributes, how much do they know about your creative execution?&amp;nbsp; If they know traditional, what do they know about your online audience?&amp;nbsp; If you want reassess your marketing to determine a budget, below are five categories to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your trade area?
	&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know?&amp;nbsp; Start by looking at a map of you vs. your competitors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Check your Google Analytics for your online footprint.&amp;nbsp; How much traffic is coming each month?&amp;nbsp; How does compare to my competitors.&amp;nbsp; Where are your sessions coming from geographically and referrals?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Sales by zip codes will help you discover opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s your competition?&amp;nbsp; There are 2 areas to consider;
	&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Online and off line.
		&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-roman;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;If you determined your trade area, you should be able to tackle this easily. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Now check the competitions selling props and where they are spending their ad budgets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are your goals?
	&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Do you have a sales objective? What&amp;rsquo;s your closing percentage?&amp;nbsp; You can usually back into your budget based on rudimentary math.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Maintain or grow market share?&amp;nbsp; Be truthful.&amp;nbsp; Volume leader or profitability?&amp;nbsp; Be true to yourself when answering this.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What DMA are you in?
	&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Depending on the size of your media market will determine whether you can afford traditional media or strictly online media.&amp;nbsp; The rule of thumb is the larger the area, the lower the CPM.&amp;nbsp; But if you live in a major metro, you will waste money if your trade area doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover at least 50% of the DMA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Unless your Unique Selling Proposition is a game changer, not very many customers will drive past 2-3 other competitors to get to your store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your USP?&amp;nbsp;
	&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type:lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;And don&amp;rsquo;t tell me we treat our customers better.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s great for getting them to come back.&amp;nbsp; I want to know if you have a unique selling proposition and if not, you need one.&amp;nbsp; Check other markets if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one?&amp;nbsp; It may not be unique to your vertical but may be to your market.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:1.0in;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve gathered the above five items, you will be able to begin formulating a marketing plan with a fiscally responsible budget to follow month in and out.&amp;nbsp; If your vendor isn&amp;rsquo;t asking you these questions or giving you this information, then they aren&amp;rsquo;t really interested in growing your market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you truly ready to answer them, give us a call and we&amp;rsquo;ll help you along the way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[When Your Commercial Is Trying Too Hard]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Everyone wants their commercial to stand out, and for automotive companies, this can be a particularly difficult feat. However, you need to be careful not to go... overboard.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants their commercial to stand out, and for automotive companies, this can be a particularly difficult feat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With so many manufacturers, models and dealers to choose from, we are inundated with everything from talking dogs to screaming men dressed in presidential garb.&amp;nbsp; One recent trend is to (hopefully) make the commercial a bit of a teaser &amp;ndash; interesting enough but vague enough that the consumer will go to the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s website to watch additional videos.&amp;nbsp; A recent example of this sort of extended advertising is the 2016 XC90 Volvo commercial.&amp;nbsp; The abbreviated version is utterly confusing.&amp;nbsp; There is an older woman driving, a young man sitting next to her, an older man twirling a wedding ring in the back seat and pictures of a young woman just married.&amp;nbsp; I watched the commercial last night with my husband, and we were both baffled.&amp;nbsp; Who got married?&amp;nbsp; Did the older man&amp;rsquo;s wife die, and that is why he is twirling his wedding band?&amp;nbsp; What is the commercial about?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus side &amp;ndash; it made us watch the commercial again just to try to figure out what the heck was going on.&amp;nbsp; And that is always a good thing.&amp;nbsp; If you google &amp;ldquo;Volvo Commercial&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll actually see several Facebook discussions with people trying to guess just what was going on there.&amp;nbsp; All good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very Negative Side &amp;ndash; I had to call and ask my husband what brand the commercial was for in order to write this blog.&amp;nbsp; I could NOT remember.&amp;nbsp; And that is as far from what a commercial should be aiming for as possible.&amp;nbsp; Also, people were not doing what the company intended/hoped.&amp;nbsp; There is actually a much longer version of the commercial that makes it much more clear what the story is &amp;ndash; but people weren&amp;rsquo;t watching it.&amp;nbsp; Much easier and more rewarding to simply blast in on social media.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line &amp;ndash; yes, a commercial should be interesting and possibly even intriguing.&amp;nbsp; And if it can push consumers to your website &amp;ndash; that is a definite win.&amp;nbsp; But this one is just trying too hard to be interesting and forgetting to actually sell the car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[While much has changed in advertising and media since this concept emerged in the 1930s from the entertainment industry, it’s widely agreed that multiple messages are required to change a consumer’s behavior.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Rule of Seven&amp;rdquo; states that a consumer needs to be exposed to a marketing message seven times before taking action to purchase the brand or product. While much has changed in advertising and media since this concept emerged in the 1930s from the entertainment industry, it&amp;rsquo;s widely agreed that multiple messages are required to change a consumer&amp;rsquo;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explosion of new advertising mediums that now exist, however, has made frequency much harder to understand and optimize. The number one question most clients will ask is: &amp;ldquo;What is the optimal frequency for my campaign?&lt;em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the measurement solutions now available to help marketers understand campaign execution, this should be easy to address, right? But, there are a number of confounding challenges that have continued to keep frequency optimization just out of reach for most advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Impressions Are Not Created Equal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, just about any campaign includes a wide variety of channels and formats, including banner, online video, search, social, mobile, TV, CRM and direct mail. Each channel and format creates a unique experience for the consumer, and therefore, a different level of engagement with the ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, banner blindness causes consumers to block out ads on their screens to only focus on content. For that reason, banner ads require a much higher frequency of exposure before they&amp;rsquo;re able to influence a purchase decision, compared to a high-engagement ad format like TV. However, the cost of serving a banner ad is remarkably less than the cost of serving a TV commercial so finding the optimal balance of frequency and cost is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters further is the issue of fraud. Advertisers will lose $7.2 billion globally to bots in 2016, according to a 2015 ANA study. So how is an advertiser to know whether their impressions are reaching their desired targets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some platforms and third parties providing insight into viewability and other metrics that help solve some of this, but there is no definitive answer. This leaves us in a scenario where, even if we&amp;rsquo;re able to determine through research what frequency is optimal, we&amp;rsquo;re unable to execute that with confidence in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Channel Frequency Is Difficult To Manage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional complexity arises when attempting to link a single consumer across channels to enable overall campaign frequency management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisers should consider running a campaign on both mobile and desktop. Each format uses unique identifiers, such as devices and cookies, to link consumers to the data used to target media to them. If two different publishers are used to execute the mobile and desktop portions for a target demographic of women 18 to 34 years old, there is no way of knowing what the overlap will be between the two platforms. Each publisher will have a different pool of cookies and devices available to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating the overlap incorrectly could result in overserving or underserving the campaign. Demand-side platforms (DSPs) and publishers that offer cross-device functionality within their owned platforms help to solve for some of this, but campaigns that require multiple publishers or channels that cannot be reconciled, such as TV, remain problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumers And Messages Behave Differently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisers spend considerable time thinking about their desired target for a specific campaign message because they know that tailoring their message to the right audience is critical to the success of a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what is often overlooked is the need to tailor the frequency with which that audience is exposed to that message in order for it to influence their purchase decision. A best practice for optimal frequency levels is typically two to three impressions per week, but optimization is rarely quantified for the specific group of consumers being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, current buyers of a brand likely need fewer impressions &amp;ndash; perhaps just one to two per week &amp;ndash; as the message is simply serving as a reminder to purchase. On the other hand, converting a lapsed consumer back to a brand likely requires a much higher frequency &amp;ndash; perhaps three to four per week or more &amp;ndash; as the hurdle to influence brand choice is greater.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With all the complexities of frequency management, audience-specific frequency often gets deprioritized but this level of precision is necessary for campaign success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story about frequency can seem pretty grim, but there are steps advertisers can take to improve. Mixing up the medium and message is a good place to start. Advertisers should test and learn across channels, formats and messages to identify differences and optimize what is within their realm of control. They need to hold their media accountable for driving incremental sales rather than click-through rate or other online metrics wherever possible to ensure they&amp;rsquo;re optimizing toward the results that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisers must also balance reach and frequency. It&amp;rsquo;s better to reach the consumers most likely to respond to an ad at the optimal level of impressions rather than reach the most consumers at a suboptimal frequency. In this way, the same budget allocated differently can drive dramatically better results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s important to focus on the bigger picture. Since we can&amp;rsquo;t sit our desired audiences down and force them to consume media, even if advertisers can identify an optimal frequency level, they&amp;rsquo;ll never hit all their desired targets the exact desired number of times. Advertisers need to focus on channels and channel combinations that allow them to get to a frequency distribution that makes sense by working toward averages and caps that drive the best results in totality. This way the &amp;ldquo;Rule of Seven&amp;rdquo; becomes more of a guideline and less set-in-stone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Why did the UK vote, and vote overwhelmingly, to leave the 28 country union known as the European Union? The reasons are many, but the at the core I&amp;rsquo;d posit that two main drivers were at play. One, the UK was one of only 10 countries in the EU that paid in more in membership duties than it received in benefits. It was a mandated welfare state to support the likes of Poland, Greece and other debtor nations that made habitually poor financial decisions and were protected from the socioeconomic and financial consequences of those decisions by the largesse of the UK, Germany, France and others. Two, the UK recognized the dangers of homogeny, the open mandated sameness around borders and the flow of commerce and people that didn&amp;rsquo;t provide them any advantage, only artificial competition and diminished safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can a new car dealer in the states learn from the Brexit? If you are a big player in your market, like the UK was to the EU, RUN from homogeny. Yes it will cause short term pain for the UK to Brexit, but when you&amp;rsquo;re a big player you should benefit from that size and not be lumped into feeding the weaker players. No lines to read in between here&amp;hellip;RUN from the manufacturer-sponsored co-op programs&amp;hellip;they are corporate welfare for the smaller players and take away so much of your (well earned) competitive advantage. On what planet would you want to share SEM, SEO, or any other providers with your closest competition? Are you insane? Look, if you&amp;rsquo;re a little guy, I get it&amp;hellip; let the big guys bankroll the partnerships that, remember, first benefit the OEM, next benefit the vendor and finally (if at all) benefit the dealer. Homogeny occurs ONLY when the economy is good; the OEMS are then incredibly smart, and can mandate otherwise flaccid programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter is coming. You can&amp;rsquo;t be born on third base forever. Survival is about safety and competitive advantage, advantage that comes from specialization and differentiation. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to spend (your own money by the way, simply held captive by the OEM) co-op funds and have it funnel right through an automated approval process, and maybe get a higher level of reimbursement. And you&amp;rsquo;re eating the same gruel as everyone else at the trough, throwing away any competitive advantage. Forging your own path takes effort, but it beats the pants off of homogeny. It&amp;rsquo;s like pulling off a bandaid&amp;hellip;or leaving the EU. The herd never wins the long race. It&amp;rsquo;s the trailblazer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As Miller Ad Agency&amp;rsquo;s SEO consultant, I get tons of questions and tasks that are based off of incorrect assumptions about how online marketing works. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly list them all, but here are a few with a reoccurring theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;URL Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many misconceptions about this let me explain how to make a good url first because it is one of the most important ranking factors a website has. A good url needs to have your business&amp;rsquo;s name in it because, out of all keywords that will rank for your business, the name is the only keyword guaranteed to generate traffic. It does not matter whether your website ends in &amp;ldquo;.com&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;.net&amp;rdquo;, or any other domain name won&amp;rsquo;t directly affect your search engine ranking. The only real affect it may have is when customers try to type your website directly into their web browser, but accidently type in the wrong domain name. &amp;nbsp;Buying extra urls with only the purpose of redirecting to your website is a bad idea. These domains will not rank on google so the only traffic that they will generate is traffic from people typing that exact url into their web browser. Needless to say, people generally don&amp;rsquo;t look for your website that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Checking Where You and Your Competitors Rank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking your ranking on google isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as typing in a search term and scrolling to where your website shows up. Google looks at several factors to individualize everyone&amp;rsquo;s search results such as location, search history, and even sex. So if you are searching from the business location, are in the applicable demographic, and frequently visit the site, your site will be ranked higher because google thinks it is more relevant to you. The most accurate way to get these rankings is through third party websites such as Bright Local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting Meaningful Traffic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all traffic driven to your website is necessarily quality. When using third party vendors and ad campaigns, keep an eye on the time on site and conversion rate. These numbers are typically significantly lower than typical visits from search. So when you are using email blast and banner ads, make sure that the visitors driven from these sites are interacting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[A Lot of a Little, or a Little of a Lot?]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[ Should you attempt to reach as many people as the budget allows, knowing those people may only be exposed to the message once, or reach a smaller number of people many times? The answer, as with most things in life, is “it depends”.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Marketing efforts are ultimately intended to build relationships with potential customers. The question though, is how do you build those relationship? Since no business has an unlimited marketing budget, often the media decision has to be made to sacrifice reach for frequency or vice versa. Should you attempt to reach as many people as the budget allows, knowing those people may only be exposed to the message once, or reach a smaller number of people many times? The answer, as with most things in life, is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When To Focus On Reach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach is the percentage of the target universe exposed to the advertising message at least once. There are many factors that can make focusing on reach an appropriate strategy. These are but a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When you have few competitors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You have a strong established brand or product&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You are the brand leader in your category&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ad message is easily understood&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The product is purchased infrequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, acceptable minimum levels of reach begin at 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When To Focus On Frequency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequency is the average number of times that each person in the target universe is exposed to the advertising message. Not surprisingly, the factors supporting the case for emphasizing frequency are antithetical to those for reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You have many competitors&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your brand or product is new or not well established.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The business has low brand awareness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ad message is complex&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The product is a frequent purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, acceptable minimum levels of frequency begin at 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, I find campaigns with limited budgets sacrifice frequency due to the more impressive sounding figures of reaching tens, or hundreds of thousands of people. Ultimately though, in &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; cases, frequency trumps reach in importance. Among all the analogies made on this subject, the simplest one to me is the most effective, and logical:&amp;nbsp; Have you ever established a meaningful relationship with someone you had contact with only once? Most likely not. Relationships of all kinds, whether personal or business, grow as a result of frequent contact over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after all, isn&amp;rsquo;t that ultimately what marketing is intended to do?&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s age, a company must be transparent and relevant to its consumers. To do so, many brands choose to sponsor individuals to represent their brand and what they stand for. Sponsoring athletes in the 2016 Rio Olympics is no different, especially because it is such a major event that is relevant to millions of people around the world. For advertising, this can be a big boost in sales and brand image. So naturally all the big brand players want in on the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ryan Lochte scandal had an adverse affect though, looking bad on the U.S. and his sponsors alike. In this scandal, Ryan Lochte and two fellow Olympians falsely reported a major crime of robbery by an impersonating Brazilian police officer. Through the investigation, police found the accusations to be false and instead the men had vandalized a gas station bathroom. Not only was there shame in what occurred from the lies, but it created a storm of anger throughout Brazil, making them seem like a violent country unfit to host the Olympics. This caused four big sponsoring brands who supported Ryan to drop him publicly and distance themselves from his newfound negative image. Naturally this makes sense in regards to advertising for the sake of the company&amp;rsquo;s brand. They would not want their brand tarnished by someone they elected as a brand ambassador on their behalf; especially since the Olympics are seen worldwide, the backlash Ryan was receiving was seen with it. But this is a risk any company makes when using a person, a human being, as an image for their brand. Because people make mistakes, just as Ryan did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes to mind the proverbial phrase &amp;ldquo;When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.&amp;rdquo; One such company did just that with Ryan&amp;rsquo;s situation, picking up his sponsorship. Using his never ending public apologies and the pleas for forgiveness, they created a campaign for &amp;lsquo;Forgiving a sore throat&amp;rsquo;. Who was this company? Pine Bros. Softish Throat Drops. With this outside-the-box thinking, good advertising was able to spin a bad situation into a leveraged campaign benefiting the company and the person involved for the better. Though the situation itself is based in negativity, Pine Bros.&amp;rsquo; intention was to spin his bad situation into a positive light. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t make mistakes? We are all human. Here advertising is used to save face for an entire nation and not just put more money into a company&amp;rsquo;s pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[Everyone enjoys a rip-roaring summer blockbuster movie, right? It’s the perfect chance to grab some popcorn, and at least for 90 minutes or so, forget about your day-to-day worries and immerse yourself in fantasy, adventure, and excitement.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Everyone enjoys a rip-roaring summer blockbuster movie, right? It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect chance to grab some popcorn, and at least for 90 minutes or so, forget about your day-to-day worries and immerse yourself in fantasy, adventure, and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers don&amp;rsquo;t lie. As of the date of this blog release, according to boxofficemojo.com*, a little over 7 BILLION dollars have been spent in the U.S. by film-goers so far this year (not counting rentals, in-store or online purchases), and almost half (3.2 billion) of that total was spent during the summer months (June through August) alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ever-rising popularity of superhero movies and the &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; popular action genre thriving, it seems that American audiences just can&amp;rsquo;t wait to catch a glimpse of what Hollywood has in store. Ask some major Hollywood production companies who measure a movie&amp;rsquo;s success in terms of dollars, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case. So, why are these seemingly highly-anticipated films flopping? Two words, over-promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the flops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Out of the Shadows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From mid-April 2015 to late-May 2016 the market was oversaturated with promotional tactics and merchandising efforts. In all, &lt;em&gt;22&lt;/em&gt; trailers were released at events, on television, or online in that span of time. A toy catalog for the film was leaked online. A 30-second TV spot premiered at the 2016&amp;nbsp;Super Bowl (that must have cost a pretty penny). On February 25, 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox&quot; title=&quot;Megan Fox&quot;&gt;Megan Fox&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Amell&quot; title=&quot;Stephen Amell&quot;&gt;Stephen Amell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;announced a sweepstakes for the film. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Arnett&quot; title=&quot;Will Arnett&quot;&gt;Will Arnett&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;debuted the first official clip at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Kids%27_Choice_Awards&quot; title=&quot;2016 Kids&#39; Choice Awards&quot;&gt;2016 Kids&amp;#39; Choice Awards&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;New footage of the film was also shown at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WonderCon&quot; title=&quot;WonderCon&quot;&gt;WonderCon&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Paramount also released a trailer, which aired during the May 30, 2016 episode of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw&quot; title=&quot;WWE Raw&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWE Raw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;since Sheamus was in the film as Rocksteady. **&lt;u&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this promotion, the movie was being hailed by critics and fans alike as a sequel that would be even better than the extremely popular (and highly-lucrative) first installment. TMNT 2 was filmed for a whopping $135 million, but brought in only $125 million &lt;em&gt;worldwide&lt;/em&gt;***. $10 million isn&amp;rsquo;t really a lot by Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s standards, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it, a loss is a loss. Yet, this failure doesn&amp;rsquo;t even take into account the unknown millions spent on promotion and product placement. So what did they get in return for their money? A financial loss, a year full of useless over-promotion, and a once-popular franchise that subsequently sunk into the sewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zoolander No. 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, the movie &amp;ldquo;Zoolander&amp;rdquo; (starring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell) became an instant hit and continued a string of comedic successes for Stiller. 15 years later, &amp;ldquo;Zoolander No. 2&amp;rdquo; was released to the delight of some and the chagrin of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paramount invested in a worldwide marketing blitz and partnered with Fiat Chrysler to feature Derek Zoolander on their advertising campaign for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_500X&quot; title=&quot;Fiat 500X&quot;&gt;Fiat 500X&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to Paramount&amp;rsquo;s ad push, Zoolander 2 had numerous promotional tie-ins with Fiat, C&amp;icirc;roc Vodka, a Zoolander skin-care line at&amp;nbsp;Kiehl&amp;rsquo;s, Samsung and more. There was even a Blue Steel Selfie app. Ben Stiller and Pen&amp;eacute;lope Cruz also appeared in character in the February 2016 issue of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)&quot; title=&quot;Vogue (magazine)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this promotional blitzkrieg, the movie which cost just over $50 million to make, only returned a paltry $55 million worldwide. You may say, &amp;ldquo;Well, they made $5 million,&amp;rdquo; but when you take the promotional costs into account, the movie actually lost money. Due to these losses (and the bombing of &amp;ldquo;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,&amp;rdquo; total losses of the two equaling $136 million!) Viacom, a minority owner of Paramount, pulled up stakes and sold their interest in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a couple of examples of the nuclear fallout that comes with a Hollywood flop. Maybe the simplest reason for the failures was that these just weren&amp;rsquo;t very well-made or well-acted. But maybe the reason is, that by the time the movies were actually released, the hype had grown so substantially and the expectations so overblown that when audiences finally screened the finished product the hype just didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to the expectation. Unfortunately, this has become a common trend in Hollywood. It seems to me that Hollywood needs to go back to the tried-and-true adage of &amp;ldquo;Always leave them wanting more.&amp;rdquo; Because, as in the case of these two franchises, when movie producers roll the dice on over-promotion and give the public too much of their product, quite often, the common outcome is less income.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Marketers Have Spoken: They Want Higher Quality Leads]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Higher quality leads create efficiency in the sales process, bringing together well informed prospects with salespeople eager to make the sale. So why haven't we seen more of these?]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Improving the quality of leads is the number one priority for marketers, according to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;2016 State of Lead Generation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;survey published by Ascend2. And why not? Higher quality leads create efficiency in the sales process, bringing together well informed prospects with salespeople eager to make the sale. In most cases these leads represent prospects who have done a significant amount of due diligence and research, consumed online reviews and know what they want, needing only to determine WHO they want to do business with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average of all market segments responding to the survey finds that the most important goals in lead generation strategy are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improving quality of leads&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 77%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acquiring new customers&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 50%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increasing quantity of leads&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 41%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Measuring performance/ROI&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 32%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Automating marketing process&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 29%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Converting website visitors to leads&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto dealers know all too well how precious high quality leads are - most shoppers only make 1.6 dealer visits. Win the first visit - maybe the second - or it&amp;rsquo;s game over. Dealers can win those first and second visits by becoming someone that shoppers get to know, like and trust. This includes websites and a digital presence where shoppers can find satisfied customers willing to tell their story. Video reviews of specific models done by customers who after several months know the car better than any salesperson. Video introductions of salespeople make shoppers comfortable and help them get to know their salesperson before they make a &amp;ldquo;cold call&amp;rdquo; at the dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward it appears there might be fewer opportunities/shoppers for auto dealers. Here&amp;rsquo;s what is needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A more tactical approach is required to increase the quantity of leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A focus on long term SEO to provide a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Acquiring new customers will require a critical analysis of new tools and methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Conversion optimization tools can be built into web platforms to increase leads per visit ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Auto dealers need to look closer at aggressive service retention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go download Chrome..&lt;/a&gt; And then install these extensions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.666666666666666px;font-family:Arial;color:#1f497d;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;&quot;&gt;Ever needed to know what color an element on a website is, like, really fast? ColorZilla has you covered. Simply click the eyedropper icon, select &amp;ldquo;Pick Color from Page,&amp;rdquo; and clickity-click on the color you want to sample from. Boom! Said color is now copied to your clipboard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

Throw down a rectangle, adjust the edges around your desired element, and find the dimensions of your ruler listed in the top left corner of your browser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.666666666666666px;font-family:Arial;color:#1f497d;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;&quot;&gt;Download WhatFont.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;devtools&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2016/10/31/devtools.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14.666666666666666px;font-family:Arial;color:#1f497d;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;&quot;&gt;So this isn&amp;rsquo;t really an extension, but it&amp;rsquo;s still worth noticing its use and worth. The built-in dev tools for Chrome are simply outstanding. Everything from inspection to rewriting code is there. Use it. Love it. We bow to you, Google. Go on, try them out! Hit&amp;nbsp;Cmd+Opt+I (or Hit Ctrl+Shift+ on PC) and poke around with the tools right now! That is.. if you have Chrome. You do have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Mute rate on Native Pre-roll]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[So, you finally decided you are going to try this native pre-roll thing. The campaign starts, and you're cautiously optimistic, but something goes wrong that you hadn't accounted for.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;So, you finally decided you are going to try this native pre-roll thing. Facebook, newsfeeds, all the rage. You create this magnificent work of art, the copy touches on all of your selling points, it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining, and it flows well. You&amp;rsquo;ve picked out the perfect person to voice it, and the cadence and tone sound great. The visuals look amazing - how could anyone look away? You look forward to the results you&amp;#39;ve heard others are getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign starts, and you&amp;#39;re cautiously optimistic. A few days go by without seeing the results you were hoping for, but you tell yourself it&amp;rsquo;s still early -maybe it is still optimizing. Another few days go by, but still not the impact everyone was bragging about. So you start to dig a little further. People are watching, but what&amp;rsquo;s wrong? The message? No that can&amp;rsquo;t be it - we have great deals going on. Then you start to do a little research, and you find something you didn&amp;rsquo;t account for; mute rates. According to multiple publishers, 85% of people watching native newsfeed videos are watching them with no sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know most people aren&amp;#39;t getting the message you were hoping to deliver, here are a few tips to entice people to listen or to get your message across if they don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add subtitles. Some sites allow you to upload a .srt file which lets you call out each line that&amp;rsquo;s read and time to display the copy. &amp;nbsp;Be wary, these can sometimes wrap the text AWKWARDLY or format it in a way you may not want.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Edit your video to add your own subtitles in your editing software. This way you can format them how you want, but the disadvantage is they will be displayed regardless of being unmuted.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click for sound. Adding a simple message or giving people a reason to add the sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding one of these three can make a big difference in getting your message across to the consumer which will help lift click through rates (CTR). Then it&amp;rsquo;s on to figuring out the next way to optimize your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Why repetitive advertising forced me to buy premium services.]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Sometimes the premium services/features pay off like with Spotify, however with Hulu I feel I was annoyed to death into switching to a premium service.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Like most people I enjoy services like Hulu and Spotify. However, I recently&amp;nbsp;switched to both premium features without ads; both for various reasons mind you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I normally don&amp;rsquo;t mind ads, but what makes them annoying is the repetitive nature of these ads. I was happy and excited when I got Hulu since I only paid $7.99 a month but, when I started to watch my shows, ads came every 15 minutes. Normally this would be ok, but every 15 minutes the same ads would repeat. You can see how this would get annoying. I tried months with ads and at one point, I said screw this and opted to pay $11.99 for the premium service without ads. I mean it worked I ended up paying a higher price to avoid the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Spotify the ads were not a problem. The problem lied in how many times you can skip a song on a mobile device.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now mind you Pandora does the same thing as well, and so do other music streaming services. But, what set Spotify above the rest was being able to download music and listen to it offline with no internet connection needed (great when your flying or traveling through the boonies). Also it has better sound quality, and of course no ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the premium services/features pay off like with Spotify, however with Hulu I feel I was annoyed to death into switching to a premium service. If the ads were better and not repetitive. I probably would have stayed with the cheaper plan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[The Market Sets the Price.]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Your best offer may not be the right offer when it comes to retail advertising. Each market has a way of setting its own price point for any product category.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Your best offer may not be the right offer when it comes to retail advertising. Each market has a way of setting its own price point for any product category. From mattresses to Mazdas, in-market consumers know the difference between a good offer and a bad offer. &amp;nbsp;If you ignore your competitor&amp;rsquo;s advertising then you run a huge risk of wasting thousands in advertising. For example, in an aggressive automotive market like Houston, Texas, the current competitive offer on a new Ford F150 is between $12,000 to $15,000 off. &amp;nbsp;If you choose to go to market advertising $5000 off a new Ford F150, you have effectively told the market - DO NOT shop your dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot be competitive with your retail message, then you can choose to not advertise or choose a different merchandising approach. In most businesses, there are many ways to merchandise a product, but researching your local market is the first step. Once you know the current price / offer conditions in your product category, you can choose to go down a similar but different path. If you cannot match $15,000 off a Ford F150, then you can choose to promote a price or a payment. Again, you need to know your market and the current market pricing to effectively promote your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have told many clients in the past, if you&amp;rsquo;re not taking a little heat from your advertising, then your retail message is not strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[We are well into the holiday season; music is playing, trees are up, candles are burning, and houses are twinkling with lights. Take that decorating to the next level and decorate your ride.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We are well into the holiday season; music is playing, trees are up, candles are burning, and houses are twinkling with lights. It almost seems that Christmas decorating is contagious; once you start, it begins to creep into every room of your house and even to the &amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;rdquo; Christmas sweater you are wearing. So, what is a holiday addict to do? &amp;nbsp;Take that decorating to the next level and decorate your ride. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a reference to painting flames on your cars or adding 20 inch rims, but literally to taking the Christmas decorations out to your car. It begins with that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lamettrys.com/decorate-your-car-for-christmas/&quot;&gt;Rudolph nose on the front grill&lt;/a&gt; and maybe some antlers on top. But that is just the beginning. Now you can have a battery-operated light-up wreath on your grill, wrap your entire car in holiday paper with a bow on top, or bypass the HOV lane rules with a full-size Santa in your front seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been good all year maybe Santa will even make one of those fantasy car commercials come true and deliver a brand new car to your driveway with a bow on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to be creative, use some of your old decorations, or even just put window decals from your local big box store on the windows. Of course there are some great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/6-ideas-for-christmas-decorations-for-cars&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; out there to help you with ideas that will also keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://shebuyscars.com/holiday-driving-safety/&quot;&gt;driving safety&lt;/a&gt; in mind. While a fun, decorated car is awesome, getting &amp;ldquo;over the river and through the woods&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&quot;http://exchange.aaa.com/automobiles-travel/automobiles/holiday-road-trip-travel-tips/#.WErmQmfnaM8&quot;&gt;SAFELY&lt;/a&gt; is the most important part.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Being Faked Out is a Real Problem – How to Make Sure Your Advertising Isn’t]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[There is a trend within the online realm that’s spilling into traditional media, and it has major consequences for your advertising – fake news.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There is a trend within the online realm that&amp;rsquo;s spilling into traditional media, and it has major consequences for your advertising &amp;ndash; fake news.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already influenced an election and has now scammed other advertisers.&amp;nbsp; By setting up fake websites, advertisers spent nearly $5 million a day for video ads that were never watched!&amp;nbsp; This fraud started in September and has not stopped. The sites that were duped are not your run-of-mill organizations.&amp;nbsp; They include Fox News, CBS Sports, The Wall Street Journal and everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite &amp;ndash; Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s an advertiser to do?&amp;nbsp; Demand accountability from your agency!&amp;nbsp; Insist that your ads are not displayed in a manner that will be associated with fake news.&amp;nbsp; Check your headlines and content.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s a giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake Ads&lt;/strong&gt; are cropping up as well.&amp;nbsp; If there is a sensationalistic story about Tiger Woods tearing his ACL, don&amp;rsquo;t click on the ad!&amp;nbsp; Chances are its fake.&amp;nbsp; Go to Google and other sources to verify it.&amp;nbsp; If it&amp;rsquo;s fake, report them to the publisher of the site.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake Reviews&lt;/strong&gt; are cropping up all over the internet including Amazon.&amp;nbsp; In fact, Amazon sued over 1,000 people last year for selling fake positive reviews of products.&amp;nbsp; Some companies are compensating customers for leaving positive reviews which is an FTC violation.&amp;nbsp; If a vendor pitches this concept &amp;ndash; run away!&amp;nbsp; Then report them.&amp;nbsp; Combat fake reviews by getting legitimate reviews to your site from real customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake Websites with fake customers that cost you thousands.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;Leave it to the evil Russian empire to come up with not only fake websites but fake human traffic that surfs the web, clicks on content, moves the mouse and has a real IP address to fool the ads.&amp;nbsp; Bot traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t fake.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s real and a real problem for advertisers.&amp;nbsp; Watch your analytics for unusual spikes in traffic and clicks that are clustered over a short time period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake Bills can look very real.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; This tactic is as old as carbon paper but it&amp;rsquo;s still effective.&amp;nbsp; Be diligent about the bills and invoices that you pay &amp;ndash; presumably online.&amp;nbsp; Fabricated emails, fake agreements or expiring URL&amp;rsquo;s are just a few of the schemes used by fraudulent companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake news is not as direct but is more damaging to your brand.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; The biggest publishers like Facebook and Google have been working very hard to write algorithms to stop Fake news from being displayed and consumed.&amp;nbsp; But they are bad at detecting it. One issue is defining it.&amp;nbsp; At what point do they decide it&amp;rsquo;s not truthful &amp;nbsp;-30%, 40% 50%?&amp;nbsp; And what about editorials?&amp;nbsp; Those are just opinions.&amp;nbsp; Add click-bait on top of it and you can see this being a slippery slope for the publishers to censor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fake news, fake websites, fake ads and fake reviews are going to be an issue that will be with us for a long time.&amp;nbsp; Choose a marketing company you can trust when deciding to promote your brand.&amp;nbsp; Not only will it affect your image, but it will affect your balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Marketing Trends to Look Out For in 2017]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[With the advent of technology, marketing has become digitized. Each year we are getting to see new marketing trends. Let’s have a look at which marketing trends are going to rule in 2017.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Marketing has become a need of the hour for every business entity. Irrespective of their scale and size, all businesses need to make an effort to create their positive image and stay in public sight. The recognition they get through marketing helps them in garnering maximum profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of technology, marketing has become digitized. Each year we are getting to see new marketing trends. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at which marketing trends are going to rule in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Augmented &amp;amp; Virtual Reality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of promotion and advertisement has completely changed with augmented and virtual reality. A game that took the world by storm, Pok&amp;eacute;mon Go, was based on the same principle. It laid the foundation of a whole new experimental level of advertisement and marketing that is based on the virtual and augmented reality trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quality &amp;amp; Interactive Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A passive content, no matter how effective it is, may cause boredom to readers. The budding trend of interactive content is really turning out to be helpful in capturing the interest of the readers. You need to look for ways in making your readers actively participate in your content to gather their interest in order to market your brand efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing through videos has been a popular means of advertisement for a long time. However, &amp;nbsp;modern technology has given rise to some remarkable changes in this technology such as live streaming and 360-degree videos. They have become a popular marketing tool within social media networks and help to give users a closer and in-depth view at the offerings and/or services provided by a particular brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Targeting Mobile Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t find a person without a smartphone in today&amp;rsquo;s times. Apart from providing the basic utility of communication, smartphones have literally become a necessity for everyone to perform a variety of routine tasks. Following this trend, most companies have already altered their marketing strategy to target smartphone users. This is why you see a lot of ads and sponsored posts popping up on your social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marketing Based on the User&amp;rsquo;s Usage Behavior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various companies track data of your whereabouts on the internet and market their stuff to you accordingly. This is the latest trend in the market that is going to be on the radar of the marketers in 2017 as well. You may have often seen the deals offered by your nearby restaurants and shopping malls in your emails or through SMS; this is because the GPS system, which tracks your location, is accessed by companies to offer you their latest deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above-mentioned marketing trends, market experts will be focusing on several other trends as well. The uses of social influencers to market a particular brand and chatbots have become a popular marketing trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends are short-lived, and so are marketing trends. People can get bored of the same marketing pattern easily. It is one such industry that requires innovation and change after a short period of life. The market trends that are hot in this season may not be that effective in the coming time. The ideal way for the marketers to make flexible marketing strategies is to incorporate changes in the runtime&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[Apple knew they had a perception problem when it came to their new AirPods and the take away of the earphone jack on the new iPhone 7. So what did Apple do? ]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Apple knew they had a perception problem when it came to their new AirPods and the take away of the earphone jack on the new iPhone 7.&amp;nbsp; People worried the earbuds would fall out.&amp;nbsp; So what did Apple do?&amp;nbsp; Did they do an infomercial explaining how they tested the AirPods?&amp;nbsp; Provide boring statistics about their success?&amp;nbsp; Of course not.&amp;nbsp; Apple prides itself on being cool &amp;ndash; on being sexy.&amp;nbsp; So they created one of the most interesting, cool and sexy ads I have seen in quite a while.&amp;nbsp; There is no voice-over.&amp;nbsp; Minimal graphics on the screen.&amp;nbsp; Just an upbeat song with a dancer doing gravity-defying dance moves while wearing his Airpods &amp;ndash; which of course, never fall out.&amp;nbsp; The commercial is true brilliance because first &amp;ndash; my husband and I watched every second of it.&amp;nbsp; It was so visually and acoustically appealing, we wanted to watch from beginning to end.&amp;nbsp; Second, it proved the point that AirPods are actually even better than older versions of earbuds because of the freedom they provide.&amp;nbsp; Third, it made theAirPods seem cool and sexy.&amp;nbsp; I want those earbuds, and I don&amp;rsquo;t even use earbuds.&amp;nbsp; Quite a lot accomplished in 60 seconds.&amp;nbsp; Bravo, Apple.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[Marketing In The On Demand Delivery Economy]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[From a marketing perspective, this will cause a shift that is anything but subtle, as we focus messaging on the time & convenience aspect of purchasing, a platform rather than just a product.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the year 2017, what kind of savage leaves their home to go get simple goods and services? We are inarguably ramping when it comes to what is called the &amp;ldquo;on demand delivery&amp;rdquo; economy, with over 280 companies providing just-in-time delivery to consumers across 16 different industries (according to the good folks at Crowd Companies Council). And growing. I can get a massage delivered via the Soothe app. I can have a bottle of wine meet me at a gathering of friends via the Favr app. And, in the right state, I can have the marijuana of my choice delivered via apps like Nugg&amp;hellip;within 10 minutes. Not a day goes by at the office where I don&amp;rsquo;t look into the parking lot and see this new economy growing. I see delivered oil changes, picked-up and dropped off dry cleaning, and mobile car washes too. If you think brick and mortar is here to stay, check out the last 5 years for the likes of Sears and K-Mart. What makes you think that ANY business is immune to this shift in consumer habits and expectations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a marketing perspective, this will cause a shift that is anything but subtle, as we focus messaging on the time &amp;amp; convenience aspect of purchasing, a &lt;em&gt;platform rather than just a product&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In 2017 and beyond its not what you sell, its how you sell it. Lest you think this is just those pesky millennials, according to the National Tech Readiness Survey, over 51% of the spending in this new 56 billion dollar &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; economy is from wallets 35 years old and up with a full 22% of those partaking being age 55 and up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing messaging will migrate away from purely product and price, as our time is assigned more and more value in this (what Thomas Friedman calls in his fantastic new book &lt;u&gt;Thank You For Being Late&lt;/u&gt;) age of acceleration.&amp;nbsp; Your brand story has to be about the ease of the process, the access afforded by technology and utility. Period. Be memorable but be a part of this new economy. While there may be exceptions that dodge this shift temporarily (think dopamine-loaded experiences like that in an amusement park that can&amp;rsquo;t be easily replicated with the current state of virtual reality), every business should be running two parallel paths where they are seeking to sell back time/convenience to their customers while telling that story with passion and consistency. Or, last one out gets the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Title><![CDATA[When Advertising Lends Its Legacy to Our Illustrious Lexicon]]></Title>
      <Summary><![CDATA[Sometimes the names of products or services we use become so ingrained into our psyche that the brand itself becomes part of our vocabulary...]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Words, oh beautiful words. How we humans adore thee. The words we assign to people, places, and objects that we encounter are the basis of how we communicate with each other and how we define the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of advertising, specific terminology is extremely important. No matter which particular language you speak, accurate word usage is meant to be expressive enough to persuade consumers to purchase a particular product or service. In many cases, branding has had an unexpected cultural effect. Sometimes the names of products or services we use become &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; ingrained into our collective psyche that the brand itself becomes part of our vocabulary. Take for instance, Coca-Cola. This drink has become such a worldwide phenomenon that, when the masses want a caramel-colored carbonated beverage, many tend to refer to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; cola as a &amp;ldquo;coke&amp;rdquo; (even if it happens to be a completely different brand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, for another example, take this object:&lt;img alt=&quot;Zipper&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2017/3/13/Zipper.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an item that most of us use every single day to keep our pants from falling down and keep our jackets fitting neatly on our bodies. As you already know, it is a zipper. But, what you may not already know is, that at one point, the zipper was a legally trademarked name owned by the B.F Goodrich Corporation (yes, the very same company that made those tires for your car). Because of its widespread popularity and usage throughout the world, the brand became synonymous with the object and the trademark was cancelled (lest the legal system become overrun with trademark infringement cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, that place with all the coin-operated machines that washes and dries your clothes? A laundromat. Yep, the &amp;ldquo;Laundromat&amp;rdquo; was once the place you went to use the machines owned and operated by the trademark owner Westinghouse Electric Co. Over the years the term has become so widely used that the trademark no longer exists and owners of laundromats are free to use this nomenclature without fear of legal repercussion when naming their coin-operated laundry facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a service becomes so popular so fast that it changes said service from a noun to a verb. Take for instance the most popular and widely used internet search engine around the world: Google. At first, Google was simply the site people used to search online for information on just about anything imaginable. And, it works. So well, in fact, that it is now being widely used as an action verb (e.g. &amp;ldquo;I needed examples of brands that prove my point of this blog, so I googled them.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you ever find yourself asking the question: &amp;ldquo;What effect does brand advertising have on my everyday life?&amp;rdquo; Just look around you. The next time you take an aspirin, jump on your trampoline, wrap your lunch in cellophane, play with a yo-yo, or even download an app off the app store, remember that, at one time or another, these brands were all registered trademarks. Now, they&amp;rsquo;re just commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <Summary><![CDATA[This about how advertising at it’s very best can be used by brands to ultimately connect to their audience on a deeper and more compassionate level — how some brands attempt to use feminism to simply cash-in on a mere moment.]]></Summary>
      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a lecture about feminism. I&amp;rsquo;m not here to educate or to guilt anyone. This about how advertising at it&amp;rsquo;s very best can be used by brands to ultimately connect to their audience on a deeper and more compassionate level &amp;mdash; how some brands attempt to use feminism to simply cash-in on a mere moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with that said, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up believing I could be anything I worked towards. My parents never set a particular goal for me. Although, they had many hopes I&amp;rsquo;d be a scientist or an architect due to my fascination with Legos and Archeology; that, is until they saw my math scores. &lt;i&gt;(I was much more interested in choir and history.)&lt;/i&gt; They never said I couldn&amp;rsquo;t achieve anything due to my height, race, gender, or sexual orientation. They did, however, prepare me for the fact that there are people in this world that would see, and sometimes say, otherwise. They mentioned that I would encounter things like greed, close-minded thinking, and ignorance. However, they also taught me that these were mere obstacles &amp;mdash; nothing that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t overcome or get beyond. &amp;nbsp;Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t discover the term feminism until my early teens, I can confidently say that I was raised in a Feminist household. This movement is nothing new. It was alive before I was. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s resurged with a new generation, advertisers and brands are using the movement to connect to that surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important for advertisers to know their audience and be able to relate. The better you can relate to your audience the more likelihood you can stand-out and stand-apart from the competition. However, it takes a lot of work and effort for advertisers to actually learn who their audience is and to really understand them &amp;mdash; not just talk at them. In this day-and-age an advertiser can&amp;rsquo;t just go through the motions and attach themselves to a movement with a simple hashtag or bold statement. They have to truly live it, support it, and invest in it. Several brands have attempted this with feminism and few have prevailed. &lt;i&gt;Secret&lt;/i&gt; is one of those brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Secret is already a predominately female brand, they chose to connect to their audience on a deeper level than just unattractive, sweaty pit-stains or stress sweats that come with day-to-day life. They focused on what really causes those pit-stains and stress sweats and to show what a lot of women&amp;rsquo;s daily life can entail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their recent campaigns, they have been highlighting and combating current women&amp;rsquo;s issues and connecting to the stress that comes with it. In one of their recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvgAdQItsI0&quot;&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt; there are two girls in an elevator, walking through a soon-to-be conversation about their new business. They test their handshake and talk through the conversation. Even practice how to handle a smug question of their skill set. The point is clear. The connection is strong, the messaging is talking directly to audience, and it only took about 30 seconds to get it. They&amp;rsquo;ve continued with similar ads about closing the wage gap, transgender matters, and overall flipping the script on gender norms. All have received praise and has increased Secret&amp;rsquo;s brand view among their audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Secret has shown to continue, and foster a connection that already existed, there are other brands that seem to be using feminism in a moment to capitalize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before I get carried away in brand-bashing land &lt;i&gt;(it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do)&lt;/i&gt;, let&amp;rsquo;s keep in mind that being in touch with your audience takes a lot of work. Like I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, you can&amp;rsquo;t just talk at your consumer, you really have to know what you&amp;rsquo;re saying. At the end-of-the-day consumers nowadays are smarter, more engaged, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this right you could end up damaging your brand more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Audi and this year&amp;rsquo;s Super Bowl spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audi is a luxury brand. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a gender-neutral product when you think of it, right? It&amp;rsquo;s a luxury car, it&amp;rsquo;s audience is really anyone that is interested in a luxury vehicle, am I right? Well, sort of. In recent years, they&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to grow out of their current luxury bubble and this was their attempt to do so. In this year&amp;rsquo;s Super Bowl &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6u10YPk_34&quot;&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; they took a chance and attached themselves to today&amp;rsquo;s feminist movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In, what is now, the criticized ad you can hear a man&amp;rsquo;s voiceover having an inner dialogue regarding what to tell his daughter about how she will be treated in society. Automatically, the audience is not female. It&amp;rsquo;s male. It&amp;rsquo;s trying to be feminist. I can only assume that they were trying to reach fathers who are currently raising young daughters and how to approach the subject of sexism in today&amp;rsquo;s world. &amp;nbsp;The tone is overall negative. It opens with him questioning how to tell his daughter that her grandmother is worth less than her grandfather because of her gender. The message, while overall, is not hiding the current struggles that women face today but leaves the conversation open to the fact that things possibly won&amp;rsquo;t change, or maybe they could. Who knows? Not the most encouraging message really, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t highlight the fact that things have changed. It ignores women who have made strides, or women who are currently making strides. It tries to capitalize on a dissatisfied area and shows no connection into how it can be further improved upon, or even how the brand is changing it. The message is overall disjointed. They end up talking at the consumer in vague terms like, &amp;lsquo;Unequal pay is bad. Inequality due to gender is bad. Maybe one day these things won&amp;rsquo;t be a problem, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to tell my young daughter about it.&amp;rsquo; This tone is ultimately doing fathers and young women a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony of Audi&amp;rsquo;s campaign is that they had no idea &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; to tell their audience, just like the dad had no idea what to tell his daughter. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to talk to feminists who were raising young women. They didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to say. They thought that if they just highlighted the facts they knew about what today&amp;rsquo;s women go through that they would somehow fall in the safe-zone, attach themselves to the movement and hailed as a brave brand. But they forgot to showcase that women have made strides and continue to do so. Their goal tried to be profound, but only comes off slightly pretentious and ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of work for brands to connect with their audience on a deeper level than what they tend to project themselves as. Advertisers need to work smarter and harder now-a-days to connect with their audience. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to just make a bold statement &amp;mdash; you have to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As we have grown in the marketing industry, we&amp;rsquo;ve started gaining more and more information about consumers. Data about consumers and habits is continuously collected and in turn, our marketing strategies have become more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to who we are targeting, we started with the general market; this includes all consumers old enough to purchase your product. It was all about casting a wide net, getting the best reach and frequency you can get for your buck. As soon as people start coming into the store, shopper marketing begins, with slashing prices on items or creative displays to draw attention. Technology has since shifted the battle for active shoppers outside of stores, and within the last few years, we have begun to hone in on what these shoppers do leading up to the purchase and have developed new ways to stay in front of them. As we began to collect information and looked at habits over time, we also started getting more targeted and created the in-market consumer. In-market consumers and active shoppers sound very similar but let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at how they differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of potential in-market consumers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For automotive, this would include people who are in the position to buy a car, have equity in a vehicle, have an aging vehicle, or are near a lease term ending.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In other consumer goods and services, it may include purchase patterns like the new iPhone launching or targeting a geolocation affected by storms, leaving structures in need of repair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of active shoppers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Visitors to your website or a retail location&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Visitors to related 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;party websites e.g. cars.com, manufacturer website, or Edmunds.com&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Researching related materials e.g. watching YouTube on related products&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Requesting information or submitting a lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This begs the question&amp;hellip; what do we do with all this information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed but these two segments are in different stages of the purchase cycle, therefore goals for your marketing should be different. General and in-market consumers need to be converted into active shoppers first. The aim for these consumers may be something as simple as driving them to your website or asking questions about your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the different objectives, your potential in-market consumers might respond better to certain messages than your active shoppers. The in-market and general market will be more easily swayed by the product they buy. They want to know if the product is healthy, does it have good gas mileage, or is it fulfilling a need? Active shoppers will be more persuaded by the details in the shopping process. Details might include ease of purchase; think Amazon one-click buying, while other details may include the viewability of your product in-store, the packaging, value, or variety available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, separate the content for each and give it a try! Show off the new safety or technology in your products instead of a high discount. Consumers might not fully understand the value of your product yet and you could even scare them with a price. Save those deals and savings for the active shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you have been wandering in the woods without any cell service, you have heard about the United Airlines fiasco that went viral two days ago. The widely-viewed video is sure to have the senior execs at PepsiCo sighing with relief, now that the public spotlight has been taken off of them following their incredibly insensitive ad starring model and reality TV celeb, Kendall Jenner. What happened you ask? A situation that many argue could have been easily avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A United Airlines flight bound to Louisville, KY from Chicago, IL was overbooked after the airline realized they needed four of their own crew members to board the flight to Louisville so they could be well-rested and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss working a flight departing Louisville the following day. Their solution? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/united-airlines-big-mistake-offering-cash-2017-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asking their paying passengers to volunteer to get off the plane and take another flight. United Airlines offered to compensate the volunteers $1,000&lt;/a&gt;. When nobody was willing to volunteer to depart the flight, four passengers were randomly selected. One gentleman, a 69-year-old, was selected but refused to leave the plane, citing that he was needed in Louisville the next day to see patients. Due to his refusal to comply, Chicago police were brought aboard and forcibly removed the doctor from the flight, resulting in him hitting his face on a nearby seat. He was then dragged from the plane. During the chaos, multiple passengers used their cell phones to record the incident. The video can be seen above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As United has now learned first-hand, we live in the Age of Information and brands are more vulnerable than ever before. The slightest misstep can become the next trending sensation, leading to vast criticism, even from people that fall outside of their customer-base. How do we protect our brands knowing this? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at each misstep of the United nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customers always come first-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems so simple and obvious, but it can require burning into your psyche; that&amp;rsquo;s the royal &amp;ldquo;your&amp;rdquo;, meaning anyone and everyone associated with the brand. Frontline employees are the most powerful piece of a brand. Sure, high-powered executives and PR specialists have enormous reach in a moment, but they never add up to the sum of the interactions of on-site worker and participants. We have to address this in two ways. The first is to really dive deep into the policies and procedures we establish for our staff. Where are the landmines in that field of policy? The what-if&amp;rsquo;s and where they hide, and examining those early and often is the first key to avoiding the disaster. A bigger overall theme to address is empowerment. We have to make our employees feel empowered to protect our brand. That feeling of ownership inspires so much &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; in our decisions that it can be the biggest factor in our brand equity. I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to know what policies exist for United employees or the exact facts of the incident. Based on the perception (which is today&amp;rsquo;s reality), there was a golden opportunity for multiple employees to own the brand in this dilemma. United stands behind the requirement of the passenger bump because the crew members needed to be in Louisville and have the required amount of rest prior to their flight the next day. However, there have been many questions if United could have looked into other flights from competing airlines to send the four employees on or rent a vehicle for the employees to have driven to Louisville themselves, seeing that it is only a four-hour drive between destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most viable option that would have appeased all parties involved would have been to simply up the compensation package for passengers volunteering to depart and take a later flight. This is a common practice by airlines. Frequent travelers even look to take advantage of situations like this one to save them money on future trips. Unfortunately for United, their measly $1,000 was not anything to be late over. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2017/04/09/why-delta-air-lines-paid-me-11000-not-to-fly-to-florida-this-weekend/#5f4059184de1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Delta Airlines handled this situation the correct way when they offered a family an $11,000 American Express gift card to take a later flight.&lt;/a&gt; Now an $11,000 compensation package could be argued as an extreme and unusual circumstance, but another key difference between this and the United predicament was that bidding war occurred at the gate and not following the plane&amp;rsquo;s boarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next obvious piece is the statement released by their CEO. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speech&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve the situation.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
~ Oscar Munoz, CEO, United Airlines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How that statement was crafted and baptized to be released is beyond me. Who thought that was a good idea? My interpretation, which seems to be fairly rampant among the masses, is that we&amp;rsquo;ve basically been told that they are sorry their policies created an unavoidable situation. Whoa. Again, perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s too obvious to all of us, save the United CEO and PR team; but the only acceptable response to something as widespread and nasty as this situation is to fall on your sword. Hard. Period. Your policies may have created the problem, but you don&amp;rsquo;t reinforce that in a mediocre attempt at an apology. You take full blame, because it&amp;rsquo;s coming anyway, and you work swiftly behind the scenes to both right the wrong and correct the policies. There may be no full means&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to right this wrong, but you exhaust every resource to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the release of the videos, the Internet has shown no mercy as they&amp;rsquo;ve trolled United Airlines on social media. Late Night Show Comedians have also put in their &amp;ldquo;two cents&amp;rdquo; with Jimmy Kimmel taking the time to craft this new commercial for United.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fight-Club&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2017/4/12/Fight-Club.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/11/investing/united-airlines-stock-passenger-flight-video/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It has been reported that United&amp;rsquo;s stocks have taken a plunge of around $250 million.&lt;/a&gt; After all of this, the CEO has issued another statement; it&amp;rsquo;s an improvement but could be argued as too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speech&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Dear Team,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment. I share all of those sentiments, and one above all: my deepest apologies for what happened. Like you, I continue to be disturbed by what happened on this flight and I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s never too late to do the right thing. I have committed to our customers and our employees that we are going to fix what&amp;#39;s broken so this never happens again. This will include a thorough review of crew movement, our policies for incentivizing volunteers in these situations, how we handle oversold situations and an examination of how we partner with airport authorities and local law enforcement. We&amp;#39;ll communicate the results of our review by April 30th.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I promise you we will do better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oscar&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brand is defined as the feelings customers have about our entities when they hear their name. Oversimplified perhaps, but that&amp;rsquo;s the short version. An incident of this magnitude has catastrophic effects on a brand. Immediate reaction and full scale attempted resolution are the only ways to try and heal those wounds. As United stands today, their front line dug a huge hole to climb out of, and their leadership somehow made the decision to dig it a little deeper. Is United too big to fail? Maybe. Has their brand suffered damage to the point that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to recover completely? I think so. What will the long-term effects be? That is still pending. Their next steps (or missteps) and time will be the only way to tell. Until then, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

My team was assigned a six-year old girl who was obsessed with Frozen. Her name was La&amp;#39;Miyah. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment_contents&quot;&gt;The preparation for La&amp;#39;Miyah&amp;#39;s room wasn&amp;#39;t hard - a separate team at Miller shopped specifically for her favorite colors and interests. Many a Frozen bedspread and pillow was bought. All my team had to do was go in and decorate well, and hoped that La&amp;#39;Miyah liked it all. Easy, right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment_contents&quot;&gt;Early Friday morning, my fellow coworkers and I hauled our large tub of goodies into the hospital and prepared ourselves mentally. Who knew what state La&amp;#39;Miyah would be in? Would she like her decorations? Would she be excited? Nervous? Weirded out? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment_contents&quot;&gt;We soon figured out the answers to all of those questions when we were greeted with a shrill scream of excitement as soon as we entered the room. The next half hour was filled with pure joy as we pulled out new blankets, stickers, make up, and, of course, all the Frozen merchandise you can imagine. By the end of it all, she was dressed up in an Elsa gown of her own, singing &amp;quot;Let it go&amp;quot; into a Frozen-themed microphone with all of us chiming in to sing the chorus with her. It was a magical moment, and her room was transformed. Gone was the stark white, disinfectant-smelling hospital room - it was now a a Frozen-inspired wonderland, a little piece of home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment_contents&quot;&gt;A couple group hugs later, we found out that La&amp;#39;Miyah was due to leave the hospital in about a week. We knew she&amp;#39;d enjoy her new decorations for a long time to come - after all, they were all hers now, and she could bring them home. While my coworkers and I brought home a priceless experience that we would never forget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <ContentText><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Recently, Miller Ad Agency was invited to revisit a past client who was losing their backyard and their brand. So, The Miller Team put together their opening salvo of this is who we are presentations and we visited to reintroduce ourselves to them and how we could help them reintroduce themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks of prep and one long day of meeting with the potential client, led to a series of month&amp;rsquo;s silence while the potential client &amp;lsquo;thought about it.&amp;rsquo; Ah - the things that attend the phrase: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll think about it.&amp;rdquo; Better to say - &amp;ldquo;Great presentation but we think we are going to go with the dancing bear and banjo player routine.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s cleaner for all concerned. I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &amp;hellip; it truly was a moment of the potential client getting some things in order in their house and soon we were engaging marketing and creative strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;5432347980199533954-...&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2017/4/28/5432347980199533954-account_id=1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the items the Client had in tow was an asset that held the potential for being beacon or simply old bacon. Something that smelled quite good - I&amp;rsquo;m sure - on the days it was originally cooked. It was a position phrase, a motif if you would, of their services. A phrase that at some moment found its way to the binding magic of music and soon became a ditty, a jingle that would grab your mind like a field sticker on a sock and hang on to you whether you wanted it to or not. The phrase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style=&quot;font-style:italic;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;Picky People Pick Hiley Mazda&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
Picky People Pick low, low prices&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a jingle that was kitsch from the beginning - sticky, but syrupy so, and with time the dated sound track only underscored the novelty of the sound. Still - even though that sound ID had been off air for years, when someone would meet an employee of Hiley, they might be heard asking&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t you the Picky People Pick Hiley&amp;rsquo; jingle. And the employee would respond with a smile or a sigh and say-&amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;hellip;Yes we are.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it did do its job to gain recognition and memorability. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounts and Creative talked and brainstormed and had many good ideas and some great ideas. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many backs and forths Hello Hiley came to, with the idea of: let&amp;rsquo;s reintroduce the new and the old shopper to the New Hiley again. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Another phrase that beat around the brainstorm was: Here&amp;rsquo;s Hiley. The great combination of locator concepts and the answer to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Need a place where a great deal and dynamic service come together? Here&amp;rsquo;s Hiley!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there was the white elephant in the room. The old jingle of Picky People Pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we use it again and if so - why? and how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was merit in all 3 of the concepts, but there was no getting around the fact that years of the radio spots and tv campaigns had engrained a melody and lyric of &amp;lsquo;Picky People.&amp;rsquo; And that&amp;rsquo;s an asset. One not readily overlooked or set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly - the client and the teams serving them honed in on freshening-up the sound track and the lyric. And from the old and cold of Picky People Pick Hiley came&lt;br /&gt;
the simplicity of the phrase: Pick Hiley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of phrase that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to spark with immediate verve but, &amp;hellip; surround it with the right visuals and invitations and it takes on life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a new car today? Pick Hiley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to shop vehicles at a family of dealerships? Pick Hiley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want a place that is going to get you bought in spite of your credit? Pick Hiley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was a phrase that was a kissing cousin of the old and would work with the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase was refreshed and reborn. And with a new sound track that had 3 sonic deliveries in an R&amp;amp;B, summer California vibe, and a Rock version - the magic was complete. Toss in fresh film shoots of the dealerships with happy people interacting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with engaging sales teams and you have the adage affirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;5410502479405594485-...&quot; src=&quot;/Portals/0/xBlog/uploads/2017/4/28/5410502479405594485-account_id=1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;What once held fire but has grown old,&lt;br /&gt;
Can be rekindled hot from cold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
